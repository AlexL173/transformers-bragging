0,0,AAPL,Cook:,We're seeing inflation and it's factored into our gross margin and OpEx that Luca reviewed with you earlier. Logistics as I've mentioned on a previous call is very elevated in terms of the cost of moving things around. I would hope that at least a portion of that is transitory but the world is -- the world has changed and so we'll see.We don't give out subscriber numbers for Apple TV+. What we do do is give out a subscriber number for our subscription number for the total number of subscriptions that we had. And I think Luca mentioned earlier we ended the quarter at 785 million. And so we were incredibly pleased with that. That's a huge growth on a year-over-year basis of 165 million. And it counts as you recall both Apple branded and third party. In terms of how we're doing with TV+ we've been honored with 200 wins and 890 nominations. We're doing exactly like we had wanted to. Weâ€™re giving storytellers a place to tell original stories and feel really good about where we are competitively and strategic position of the product.Well putting aside any kind of thing that sits on our road map for a second in that area which we obviously wouldn't talk about in the call I would say that I think Apple Card has a great runway ahead of us. It was rated to the #1 midsized credit carding customer set by J.D. Power and is getting -- has fast become people's main credit card for many many people. And the growth of Apple Pay has just been stunning. It's been absolutely stunning. And there's still obviously a lot more there to go and because there's still a lot of cash in the environment. And so I think that both of these and whatever else we might do have a great future ahead.Yes. Chris it's Tim. What I would say is that iPhone has become an integral part of so many people's lives now more than ever. And the active installed base of iPhone continues to grow and is now at an all-time high. And during December as we had mentioned we had a record number of upgraders and grew switchers strong double-digit which I think speaks to the strength of the product. And that's all baked into some -- an enormous customer satisfaction rating of 98% and doing well throughout the geographies. And I've mentioned some of the geos that we track and how many units that we have on the top-selling model charts. And so -- and even though this is the second product announcement that has 5G in it we're still really in the early innings of 5G meaning if you look at the installed base and look at how many people are on 5G versus not and we don't release those exact numbers but you can do some math and estimate those we maintain a very optimistic view on iPhone long term.I think I'll let Luca comment on the second part of that. But if you back up and sort of look at how we're doing even though we have 785 million subs relative to the total number of products offered and the customers that's offered in there's still a lot of room to grow there. And so I -- the way that I look at it is that we -- there's a lot more greenfield in front of us.We don't make purely financial decisions about the content. We try to find great content that has a reason for being. And we love shows like Ted Lasso and several of the other shows as well that have reason for existing and may have a good message and may make people feel better at the end of it. But we're -- but I don't view that we've narrowed our universe the things we're selecting from. There's plenty to pick from out there. And I think that we're doing a pretty good job of it as we speak.Well the -- with the Apple Watch there's literally not days that go by without me getting notes about someone that's received a health alert. Maybe it's to do with their cardiovascular health. Or more recently a lot of people have told me that they fell and was knocked unconscious and couldn't respond and the watch responded for them to emergency contacts and emergency personnel. And so there's a lot that we're doing today. My sense has always been that there's more here. I don't want to get into a road map discussion in the call. But we continue to kind of pull the string and see where it takes us. But we're really satisfied with how we're doing in this area because we are fundamentally changing people's lives and in some cases saving people's lives. So it's an area of great interest.,0.326852898,0.971113682,0.455563638
1,1,MSFT,Hood:,"Thanks  Brent. Yeah I think the important thing when you think about bookings performance is to talk about what happened before you got to those volatile  the large Azure commitments that create some of that top comparables that we're talking about. And that's really the opportunity to execute against selling the Microsoft  day to day  which is Dynamics  Microsoft Cloud  GitHub in the broader universe. Our execution on that was actually quite good. Very good renewals  very good recapture rates  very good add - ons  meaning you sell outside of the normal pattern  and so I feel very good.  It's very consistent execution to your point  Brent  this quarter versus others on that front. And then to your point  it's important not to time some of these larger long-dated Azure contracts. That's where the volatility is  the day-to-day execution of Azure commitments  actually was very consistent. The volatility comes with some of the bigger things and with a lot of them in Q4  last on a comparable basis in Q1 and that happens from time-to-time. Thanks  Karl. I want to start by saying and repeating something that Tatia  I think was careful to include in his remarks. And it is the central nature of the PC to relay the nature of both hybrid work and fundamentally about getting jobs done. And I think the central role it's played we've talked about  I think  now for a number of quarters  and I think the reality of that continues to exist. I think the come more real for people as we talk about what hybrid is going to look like and continue to learn what hybrid is going to look like.  And to that end your PCs  the market grew this quarter  and it was constrained by supply. I believe Q2 will also be a strong demand quarter that is constrained by supply. But even with that  we see a growing market. And in particularly  in both Q1 and Q2  we see a strong demand in the commercial segment. I think that ties directly back to some of Satya 's comments about the central nature of the device. Then of course  we do get some benefit  Karl  because revenue per license is higher in commercial than it is in the broad market.  Those things together  which is a growing market  strong Windows performance within that market  in commercial in particular  And then  the resulting higher revenue per license results  and I think a very strong position in Q1 and Q2. Thank you. Yes  thanks  Satya and I think really  got to the heart mark of where I tend to go when you think about -- when you see the intensity of customers across industries and across geographies  wanting to adopt digital technology for many of the reasons Satya just explained. And there's numerous scenarios across  I think  most industries. That acceleration  of course  regardless  frankly  of the overall environment is a place where we feel like we offer the best portfolio at the Microsoft Cloud and with our Industry Clouds to make that doable with a very fast time to value.  And so our ability to execute against that regardless to the spend environment  means we've got the right portfolio and a high value to customers as deployable quickly that can get them results when they need that. And I think that's reflected in most of the surveys that really point to preference for  to help customers do that. So while -- of course  it's hard to predict what any quarter or second half will do. The things I believe to be sustainable are a push to digital -- a push to Cloud help customers get value quickly  and us being a trusted advisor and partner to help that happen. Thanks  Satya. And Kash  as you probably noted I did talk about -- in this quarter  we did add  year-over-year  14% headcount growth. And I think that's important  because when you talk about how  what  and why  we do remain focused on being a great employer  to have people achieve those goals and be able to achieve them here. Secondly  you asked some good questions about the supply chain impact  and specifically around data center  given our spend to this quarter  and my guidance is it should be similar next.  A lot of that cash is long lead time. So we have good understanding of lead times required to meet the capacity signals that we're seeing. I think we are doing good job managing that  it's not to say we're not impacted. Multiple suppliers are important to be able to manage through that  and I feel the team has done a very good job. In terms of specific impacts  I noted it  and some remarks  I do think demand will exceed supply in PCs and Surface for us.  This quarter  particularly in premium devices  in consoles for Xbox and another bit of -- another challenge I noted will just be -- we'll just need to watch the advertising market through the quarter  because obviously their willingness to spend is entirely connected to their supply as well. And Raimo  just maybe to add  you may have been asking also just about the nature of some of the comments I was making about on - prem server results. And it really points to hybrid strength. That's the way I tend to think about it and whether that's the fact that people are committed to Windows and SQL server and whether they run that in Azure or whether they run it in a multi-cloud environment it's a commitment to the platform and so I just wanted to make that  probably  more clear as one of the drivers of our Server products and Cloud KPI execution this quarter. 
Amy Hood: Yeah  and I do think frankly  Brad  just the signals we're seeing on consumption and usage we'd say customers are doing a good job of figuring out the priority list that delivers value to them  as Satya is saying. I do know obviously  that the labor market has a real impact  and I think that's also why you're seeing investment being made by us in particular  into training and skilling  making deployment easier  making time-to-value faster  really having documentation that makes getting started and trials far more accessible.  And so when you talk about adding productivity it's also an investment we as Microsoft need to make  and to making our products easier and really terrific to get going on  so that you're not constrained in the way that you're talking about. Thank you. ",0.002931456,0.003050983,0.000109175
2,2,NVDA,Huang:,Sure. Thanks a lot. First of all it's hard to estimate exactly how much and where crypto mining is being done. However we can only assume that the vast majority of it is contributed by professional miners especially when the amount of mining increases tremendously like in-house [ph]. And so we created the CMP. And CMP and GeForce are not fungible. You could use GeForce for mining but you can't use CMP for gaming. CMP is yields better and producing those doesn't take away from the supply of GeForce. And so it protects our GeForce supply for the gamers. And the question that you have is what happens when on the tail end of this? There's several things that we hope. And we learned a lot from the last time but you never learn enough about this dynamic. What we hope is that that the CMPs will satisfy the miners at work will stay in mines in the professional mines. And we're trying to produce a fair amount of them and we have secured a lot of demand for the CMPs and we will fulfill it. And what makes it different this time is several things. One we're in the beginning of our RTX cycle whereas Pascal was the last GTX. And now exactly was at the tail end of the GTX cycle because the last GTX and it was the tail end of GTX cycle. We're at the very beginning of the RTX 30 cycle. And because we reinvented computer graphics we reset the computer industry. And after 3 years the entire graphics industry has followed. Every game developers need to do ray tracing every content developer and every content tool has moved to ray tracing. And so if you lose ray tracing these applications are so much better. And they simply run too slow on GTX's and so we're seeing a reset of the install base if you will. And at a time when the gaming market is the largest ever we've got this incredible install base of GeForce users. We've reinvented computer graphics and reset the install base and create an upgrade opportunity that's really exciting at a time when the market is the gaming market the gaming industry is really large. And what's really exciting on top of that is that gaming is no longer just gaming. And it's infused into sports e-sports. It's infused into art. It's infused into social. And so gaming is -- it has such a large cultural impact now it's the largest form of entertainment. And I think that the experience we're going through is going to last a while. And so one I hope that crypto will -- the CMP will steer our GeForce supply to gamers. We see strong demand and I expect to see strong demand for quite some time because of the dynamics that I described. And hopefully in the combination of those two we'll see strong growth and through strong growth in our core gaming business through the year.The more you buy the more you [indiscernible] there's no question about that. And the reason for that is because we're in the business of accelerated computing we don't accelerate every application. However for the applications we do accelerate the acceleration is so dramatic. And because we sell a component the entire system the TCO the TCO of the entire system and all the services and all the people and the infrastructure and the energy cost has been reduced by X factors sometimes 10x sometimes 15x sometimes 5x. And so the -- so when we set our mind on accelerating a certain class of applications and recently we worked on true [ph] quantum so that we could help the quantum industry quantum computing industry it's already there simulators so that they could discover new algorithms and invent future computers even though it won't happen until 2030. For the next 20 years that we're going to have 15 years we're going to have some really really great work that we can do using NVIDIA GPUs to do quantum simulations. We recently did a lot of work in natural language understanding in computational biology so that we could decode biology and understand how biology is to infer to understand it and to predictively improve upon it and design new proteins. Those words are so vital. And that's what accelerated computing all about. Our Enterprise software and I really appreciate the question. Our Enterprise software used to be just about the BGP which is virtualizing GPU inside the VMware environment or inside the Red Hat environment and makes it possible for multiple users to use one GPU which is the nature of Enterprise virtualization but now with NVIDIA AI NVIDIA Omniverse NVIDIA Fleet Command whether you're doing collaboration or virtual simulations for robotics and digital twins design your factory or you're doing data analytics learning what the predictive features are that could create an AI model predictive model that you can deploy out at the Edge using Fleet Command. We now have an intense suite of software that is consistent with today's enterprise service agreements. It's consistent with today's enterprise business models and allows us to support customers directly and provide them with the necessary service promises that they expect because they're delivering -- they're trying to build a mission critical application on top. And more importantly by creating this -- prioritizing our software we provide the ability for our large network of partners OEM partners value added resellers system integrators solution providers for this large network of hundreds of thousands of IT sales professionals that we are connected to through our network we give them a product that they can take to market. And so the distribution channel the sales channel VMware the sales channel of Cloudera the sales channel of all of our partners [indiscernible] and design Autodesk [indiscernible] so on so forth all of these sales channels and all of these partners are now partners and taking our stacks to market. And we have a fully integrated system that are open to the OEM so that they could create systems of run the stack. And it's all certified all tested all benchmark and of course very importantly all supported. And so this new way of taking our products to market whereas our cloud business is going to continue to grow and that part of AI is going to continue to grow that business is direct. We sell components directly to them we support them directly. But there are 10 of those customers in the world. For Enterprises there are thousands industries far and wide. And so I think this -- we now have a great stack and a great software stack that allows us to take it to the world's market so that everybody could buy more and save more.Well thank you. Thank you for joining us today. NVIDIA computing platform is accelerating. Launched at GTC we are now ramping new platforms and initiatives. There are several that I mentioned. First enabled by the fusion of NVIDIA RTX NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA [indiscernible]. We built Omniverse a platform for virtual collaboration and virtual worlds to enable tens of millions of artists and designers to create together in their own metaverse. Second we lay the foundation to be a three check data center scale computing company with GPUs DPUs and CPUs. Third AI is the most powerful technology force of our time. We partner with cloud and consumer internet companies to scale out and commercialize AI powered services. And we're democratizing AI for every enterprise and every industry. With NVIDIA AGX certified systems the NVIDIA Enterprise AI Suite pre-train models for conversational AI language understanding recommender systems and our broad partnerships across the IT industry we are removing the barriers for every enterprise to access state-of-the-art AI. Four the work of NVIDIA Clara in using AI to revolutionize genomics and biology is deeply impactful for the health care industry and I look forward to telling you a lot more about this in the future. And fifth the electric self driving and software defined car is coming. With NVIDIA DRIVE we are partnering with the global transportation industry to reinvent the car architecture reinvent mobility reinvent driving and reinvent the business model of the industry. Transportation is going to be one of the world's largest technology industries. From gaming metaverses cloud computing AI robotics self driving cars genomics computational biology NVIDIA is doing important work and innovating in the fastest growing markets today. As you can see on top of our computing platforms that span PC HPC Cloud Enterprise to Autonomous Edge we've also transformed our business model beyond chips. NVIDIA vGPU NVIDIA AI Enterprise NVIDIA Fleet Command and NVIDIA Omniverse adds enterprise software license and subscription to our business model. And NVIDIA GeForce Now and NVIDIA DRIVE with Mercedes Benz as the lead partner our end-to-end services on top of that. I want to thank all of the NVIDIA employees and partners for the amazing work you're doing. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

3,3,TSLA,Musk:,"We hope we donâ€™t need to increase the pricing further. The current pricing is anticipating what we think is the probable growth in costs. And if those growth -- if that growth in cost does not materialize we actually may slightly reduce prices. So should we currently anticipate making significant price increases. But obviously we donâ€™t control the macroeconomic environment. If governments keep printing vast amounts of money and if thereâ€™s -- if there are not significant increases in lithium extraction and refinement and other raw materials such that everyone is competing for a limited amount of raw materials then obviously that will drive prices to high levels. So if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what the future is going to be like weâ€™ll adjust accordingly. But the current prices are what we -- the current prices are for a vehicle delivered in the future like 6 to 12 months from now. So this is our best guess.Yes.If inflation keeps going crazy $500 billion might be like $20 billion today. I donâ€™t know. So weâ€™ll see what $500 billion buys you in a decade but it might be a lot less. So I donâ€™t know if weâ€™ll -- that seems like a lot of cash. I donâ€™t know. Weâ€™ll try to do something useful with it. I mean Zach I donâ€™t know -- I realize thatâ€™s problem thatâ€™s for sure.Maybe just everyone [Technical Difficulty]Iâ€™m not sure if weâ€™ve actually done a comparison of Cybertruck parts versus regular truck parts. I mean Lars?Mention count.I mean the entire rear -- kind of half of the car is one cast.All right.Do we expect to expand? Yes we do expect to expand Giga Nevada. Thereâ€™s a lot of room for expansion there and we do expect to increase output from Nevada but by far the biggest increase in output will be from Giga Texas.Yes. If it would continue but there are some parts that are sourced in China that apply worldwide. And that would be -- that would impact production elsewhere. But all indications are that we are -- our Giga Shanghai is back in production at fairly high levels already and so are our suppliers. So we donâ€™t think this is going to be a big deal.There are no discussions currently underway for incremental compensation for me.Yes I think thatâ€™s -- thereâ€™s nothing more to be said on that but weâ€™re -- yes we want to do the right thing with respect to the whole system.Absolutely.And ones I noticed that we are seeing that the -- having real-time feedback for driving habits is actually resulting in Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way because they can see the -- they get real-time feedback on okay this is affecting my insurance rate or it isnâ€™t. And so when people see it -- they can see a real-time score they realize if I make the following changes in my driving habits then I pay less in insurance then they have a very -- like a real-time feedback loop for driving for safer driving and an incentive to do so. So it is -- actually what weâ€™re seeing is it is causing people to drive their cars in a safer manner which is also net good.Yes. I think it improves just overall macroeconomic efficiency. Itâ€™s also a feedback loop for Tesla because we see if there is crash both large or small like we sort of see exactly what that caused. And then we think about how can we change the design of the car or the software in order to minimize the probability of that accident. Most accidents are minor but how do you have those accidents occur less frequently? And how do we make the repair associated with that accident super fast? Like aspirationally it would be like a same-day repair of a collision which is night and day difference compared to sometimes having to wait for a month while insurance claims are settled and figured out -- because Tesla is also doing collision repair.Yes.Yes. And basically the customer experience is just vastly better because if thereâ€™s an accident thereâ€™s no argument. Weâ€™ll repair it immediately. And this is as compared to arguing with an insurance company and then a claims adjuster and then a collision repair center. And this can be a nightmare basically. So weâ€™re trying to turn a nightmare into a dream with Tesla Insurance.Thank you.""",0.002689749,0.002719402,2.97E-05
4,4,GOOG,Porat:,Thanks for the questions. So in terms of YouTube I think there are a couple of questions in your question. In terms of the deceleration in the year-on-year revenue growth rate relative to the first quarter the largest factor was lapping an exceptionally strong quarter in direct response as we noted last year. In addition to that direct response lapping there were a couple of other items worth noting. First as I've already mentioned the war that did have an outsized impact on YouTube ads relative to the rest of Google. And that was both from suspending the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia as well as as I noted earlier the related reduction in spend primarily by brand advertisers in Europe. Then in addition as we mentioned on the third quarter earnings call we continue to experience a headwind from ATT primarily in direct response. And the dollar impact from ATT has been consistent since it was implemented in April of last year. And then there's the FX headwind I've already commented on. I would say to the other part of your question we're experiencing a slight headwind to revenue growth as Shorts viewership grows as a percentage of total YouTube time. We are testing monetization on Shorts and early advertiser feedback and results are encouraging. And the team is focused on closing the gap with traditional YouTube ads over time. So we're excited about the new opportunities with Shorts but a slight headwind.So in terms of the first question impact from the war I think it's too early to comment. Tragically it is still ongoing; so too early to comment there. And then overall in terms of YouTube and engagement I noted on both YouTube's advertising business as well as the subscription businesses the performance there I'd say over the past few years we've seen significant investment in online video. There's been a ton of innovation. We think innovation is positive. Broadly we continue to benefit from the fact that there are 2 billion logged-in viewers who visit YouTube every single month. And people are creating comment -- content on YouTube at a very active rate. We're really pleased with what we see there and our team does remain focused on innovating and helping creators grow. As Sundar said Shorts now has 30 billion daily views. That's 4x higher than a year ago. And I think that really goes to your question about the level of activity that we're seeing.Yes. In terms of geographic color just to even broaden out your question a bit more and go through the various regions so in the U.S. we were pleased with the 27% year-on-year growth. And I think nothing to call out there. In Europe as you noted in your question the slightly bigger impact from the war in Ukraine than in other regions and then the sizable delta between fixed and floating really reflects the meaningful strengthening of the dollar versus the euro. I guess to the heart of your question with respect to APAC the main thing there is to take you back to a year ago we were lapping a substantial 39% growth rate in constant currency. And so this really reflects lapping that sizable growth relative to more muted ads performance in APAC this first quarter and it really takes you just back to last quarter. In other -- Americas it was much more about the FX headwind more than anything else.And then in terms of the YouTube subscription businesses. As I said they continue to deliver substantial revenue growth and that was driven by subscriber growth for both YouTube TV as well as YouTube Music and Premium. So pleased with what we're seeing there.,0.003172994,0.003740191,0.000567198
5,5,META,Wehner:,Yes sure. On the $10 billion impact we shared our estimated $10 billion impact on ATT last quarter to give a sense of the order of magnitude and we believe itâ€™s still to be that order of magnitude on the expected impact. Itâ€™s not a precise point estimate and we donâ€™t plan to update it. Also worth noting itâ€™s â€“ thatâ€™s not a â€“ itâ€™s not a lapping. There was an impact from ATT in the second half of last year as well. So thatâ€™s not a â€“ all in the increment. There was an impact last year. Also beyond ATT we expect to see additional targeting and measurement headwinds from iOS 15 and other regulatory changes. I donâ€™t think we have anything at this point to share about 16. And then I think also Justin you asked about sort of the second half we would expect the growth rate in Q3 to be modestly higher than the Q2 rate since we will be lapping the first full quarter impact of ATT in Q3 but thereâ€™s obviously a lot of uncertainty baked into our Q2 outlook and that implies uncertainty in the second half as well.Yes. And Youssef itâ€™s Dave. So on the retention and recruiting front I mean Iâ€™d say we continue to have success in recruiting as demonstrated by the 5 800 net new hires this quarter. So we're pleased with our ability to do that. Also on the retention front attrition which has stepped up since what we experienced during the pandemic is really still broadly consistent with levels that we had seen pre-pandemic. So it's definitely something that we're tracking and obviously the stock price is something that we watch but the trends are relatively in line with expectations. So from that sense we feel like we're doing okay.So I'll take the first question sort of in terms of the regional growth. So growth slowed in all regions due to pricing headwinds currency was obviously a headwind in all the international regions. Europe decelerated very meaningfully and the existing headwinds were compounded by the effects of obviously the Ukraine war. In North America we have a relatively higher exposure to off-site objectives. So the targeting and measurement challenges continue to impact growth in that region more. Also I'd note that in North America impressions were down year-over-year in Q1. So ad impressions were down year-over-year though the rate improved from Q4. So it was primarily a demand-driven deceleration. When we look at APAC and the Rest of World it benefited from strong demand in products like Click-to-Messaging ads. In Rest of World growth decelerated the least of all regions. Macro conditions in Brazil improved a bit after softness in the second half of 2021. And then in APAC it was â€“ relative strength was pretty broad-based but I'd call out particular strength in India and that's benefiting from good supply tailwinds in terms of impression growth.Yes. And I can address the Reels question. I think we've touched on it a few times. So I don't know if I have a whole lot that's additive but it now makes up a meaningful portion of people's time on Instagram. Mark gave the stat that it's over 20% of people's time on Instagram. So that speaks to there being a good opportunity as we ramp ads in Reels but it's very early days in terms of ads in Reels. But that being said it's going to take â€“ it's going to be as Sheryl said a multiyear journey. If you look at Stories Stories we really began ramping in 2018. And at the end of last year we mentioned that in developed markets Stories on a sort of per time basis was monetizing at a similar rate as feed. So it took many years for that gap to close and there's still work to be done across the world on that front. But Reels is going to be a similar opportunity but also it will take time for us to close that gap. But given that it's a good amount of time that people are spending in Reels that is a good opportunity for us over that time period.Yes Alan because of the loss of users in Russia we do expect there to be a sequential decline in MAUs in Europe. And we think that will feed over into overall global because I think that will tip it to be flat to down. Just as a reminder government restrictions on Facebook access in Russia were implemented in late February through early March. So some Russian users were still on our service as active users during our Q1 calculation. So part of that is just the way we calculate MAUs the last month of the quarter. And so that's going to spill over into Q2. I think it's clear that short-form video is a massive opportunity for the industry broadly and we're very pleased about the offering that we have with Reels and the opportunity for us to compete for share and time in the market. Obviously other competitors are â€“ have strong offerings like TikTok but we're pleased with what we've got with Reels and the efforts that we're making to grow that important product.,0.003468951,0.004957318,0.001055667
6,6,UNH,Witty:,Brian thanks so much. And Justin just to come back to your second question around pipeline as you'd expect we don't comment on transactions speculation. But let me just make a few general points. You saw during Q1 we successfully closed and announced the bringing of Refresh Health into the organization. great business built by Steve Gold and his team helping us build out our behavioral delivery capabilities within OptumHealth complements super nicely. Our largest behavioral health network that we already have across the country from the benefit side of the business so continue to operate there. I'd say overall our pipeline of opportunities I actually think is probably as diverse as it's ever been and probably deeper than it's ever been. So I think from a potential capital deployment capability I think we feel pretty optimistic about that. We continue -- as you see we continue to be extremely disciplined about ensuring of all the very many opportunities that we see that we focus on the ones which first and foremost nestle centrally within our core strategies those five growth areas I touched on earlier Refresh Mental Health is a great example of that. So it's right into that value-based proposition in terms of how we believe we need to bring behavioral health management alongside medical management. So first off we need to sit centrally within our strategic framework. We need to believe in the culture and the capability of the leadership teams that we're welcoming into UnitedHealth Group. And of course the economics have to fit with our demanding expectations to support our long-term growth ambitions of 13% to 16% and also the returns that our shareholders rightly expect. So that drives us forward. I feel confident about our ability to continue to deploy capital which has always been a key element of helping us deliver long-term growth. So hope that gives you a little sense of where we stand Justin. And maybe with that and the next question.Yes. Gary thanks so much. Let me go straight to John to respond to that.Thank you so much John. Gary thank you very much. Emma next question please.Kevin could you just repeat the second part of the quarter? I just lost you in the middle of that just. Could you just repeat that?Yes. Okay great. Listen Kevin thanks so much. I'll hand to Dr. Decker to respond to you on the first part of where that extra $100 000 taken us up to $600 000 is coming from and it'd be good for you to hear that from him. I think in terms of how we think about how we invest in this space I'd say each one is pretty much a unique situation right? I mean every doctor clinic they're all different. They've all got tremendously different histories situations dynamics. And obviously we take a view within a broad piece of not just what have they achieved to date but how alongside the rest of our capabilities can we build opportunities and value for patients and the utilizers of those environments. And that's what really drives our kind of economic assessment. Now I think what you can see is the way in which we understand and seek to continue to learn how to work better and better within the value-based envelope and how we can utilize the skills of these organizations allows us be confident in being able to set very fairly reward people who choose to join our organization and that's what's driving our ability to be successful integrators of some phenomenal people and their teams across the country. And I'm so pleased they stay inside the organization. And itâ€™s super nice to be able to see OptumHealth continue to strengthen itself as a physician-led organization. And I think that is really contrasting to many others out there. This is an organization led by physicians at every level of the organization and it makes a huge difference in terms of the way the heart and soul of this place is starting to be. And I think that's what underpins a lot of our contribution and competitiveness. With that Dr. Decker as the physician leader of the organization maybe you could just reflect a little bit on how you're successfully driving up that growth rate.Thank you so much. Kevin thanks so much for the question. Much appreciated. Next question please.Stephen thanks so much for the question. John?John thank you very much Stephen thanks so much for the question. And the next question please.Josh thanks so much. It's a great question actually. And I would say -- and again I'm going to ask Wyatt to go much deeper for you on this. I would say that over the decade or so that this has been developing at Optum I think our views are probably -- it's fair to say evolved quite a bit in terms of what the right way to operate. And not only in terms of what might be the right blend of relationships with ourselves and the physicians Also the role of physicians versus advanced practice clinicians and others and also the role of what happens in a clinic-based environment versus a home-based environment. And I'd say particularly over the last I don't know maybe the last 24 months I think that has moved on quite a lot in terms of how we're thinking about this. So I would just frame it. I'm going to hand right now to Wyatt but I would just frame it maybe Josh in those three dimensions right? Location kind of relationship between and then type of clinician are I think evolving dynamics around which we're becoming more and more opinionated. Maybe on that Wyatt you could go a little deeper.Wyatt thanks so much. Josh thanks for the question. Next question please Emma.Ricky thanks so much for the questions. Before I go to Heather let's tackle your first question -- your second question first and maybe I'll go to Tim Noel to comment a little bit from the perspective of the Medicare book that you're looking at in terms of the home testing opportunity and dynamic.Tim thanks so much. And Dirk?Excellent. Thanks so much. Now just before I hand over to Heather to go deeper on the OptumRx piece. Ricky as you alluded to as we roll into next year in particular we're coming into a kind of a bit of a new cycle for pharma in a way in terms of the biosimilar opportunities and obviously you refer to one very significant one really an important one. So it's clearly going to be a super dynamic environment which we're Heather's team is absolutely engaged in and getting ready for. I would just say as I look very pleased to see that acceleration of growth rate during the first quarter and that's down to a tremendous amount of hard work in terms of developing the right product and service driving our retention and of course win rate. And one of the things I keep an eye on is the number of bid opportunities that we have in front of us right in terms of what's coming in. It's been super interesting to see that ratchet up over the last 12 months or so. So the market -- the market is activating. I don't think you'd be super surprised to hear that given the last couple of years but it is activating. So we're seeing more and more business come to market. Been super reassured by our sustained very very high retention rates. And Heather now maybe can reflect a little bit on how she sees that all playing out over the next year or two. Heather?Great. Heather thanks so much. And Ricky thank you very much for the question. We just have time for one last question. So Emma maybe go to the last question.Steven thanks so much. I think maybe you misspoke. It's a â€“ we increased our guidance range this year by $0.10 both at the top and the bottom of the guidance range just to reconfirm that. But listen that raise is essentially based on the strong performance of Q1 good start to the year. We feel good about that. While -- as always there's a lot of moving parts in our world and you've heard from people like Brian in some detail about some of the dynamic of the first quarter actually as it all comes together the year is kind of shaping up pretty much in-line with the expectations we were laying out to you all in November last year. Strong performance is supported by execution across all of our businesses. I would say all of the core businesses of Optum of UnitedHealthcare have started the year well. We continue to be very focused on the execution of those within those businesses of course and I think what you're continuing to see and I hope you've heard some of that in the conversation today and it's certainly reflecting through the results. is the synergy opportunities which are coming to life between the two organizations you heard a lot about value-based care now that whole value-based care model which we believe is truly capable of transforming experiences not just for patients but for physicians and payers. That's a product of the two organizations working together. The development of in-home care same thing very much being led by the two organizations working together. And increasingly what we're seeing as we strengthen our capabilities in areas like that with our deployment of capital and some of the acquisitions weâ€™ve been making. So for example organizations like naviHealth Landmark and others that's then driving strong external growth as well. So really really demonstrating how building these kind of fundamental innovations in the way in which care can be thought about can then not just be attractive to UnitedHealthcare of course but also to many other payers and completely reinforces our deep commitment to be a multi-payer organization building products and services in Optum which work not just for UHC but for payers across the spectrum. And that's what you're seeing supporting the business. And it supports our confidence in raising the outlook for the rest of this year. So I hope that gives you a clear sense of that and very much appreciate that final question Steven. And thank you to everybody else for joining the call this morning. We truly appreciate your interest and your attention. I hope what you heard in the call today is a strong sense of the confidence in our long-term strategy. And as I just said again an intensely disciplined focus in its execution. We're aiming to create value for consumers advancing our mission and delivering high-quality diversified growth in this quarter and for many years to come. We look forward to sharing that progress with you again when we next talk in July. Thank you so much and appreciate your attention today.,0.114576149,0.555262029,0.220347154
7,7,JNJ,Wolk:,Yes good morning Joanne. Thanks for the question. With respect to operating margins overall which is really I think at the heart of your question in the front -- the first quarter I should say we do tend to adopt a little bit more of an aggressive approach to advertising and promotion and hopes of getting the full year benefit of that promotion to the topline lift throughout the year. And I would say on R&D it's also a little bit front-end loaded this year simply from the standpoint of the progression of our pharmaceutical pipeline as well as digital robotic surgery. So in pharmaceuticals think about nipocalimab our RSV vaccine those had very nice progression. Teclistamab may be moving a little bit faster than we anticipated as well as being able to launch Carvykti. There was a healthy amount of inflation built into our P&L in the January guidance. What I think our teams have seen in the -- let's say the first four months of this year is an uptick in that inflationary impact of about 10% or 15%. So still very manageable. Again as you heard in some of the prepared remarks we anticipate that that inflationary pressure as well as commodity scarcity will subside a little bit in the second quarter and then hopefully more pronounced in the second half of this year. If it doesn't it's certainly something that will keep our attention. And we have the resources to adjust accordingly to make sure that we not only meet the needs of long-term value creation but also meet short-term performance expectations. So we all think it's very manageable at this point in time but it's something that we're not taking for granted. We're being very active with cost initiative programs. As we look to separate the two companies we are looking at ways to streamline technology processes things that will lead to leverage on the P&L.I'm going to check the transcript on that Josh just to be sure. But listen I think what you would hear as Joaquin was sitting here is that he supports all the businesses with respect to innovation. We realize that our calling card is innovation and we're going to have growth across all of our franchises when we have products that matter that are differentiated that are beyond the current standard of care and meeting consumer needs as well. I actually want to credit Ashley and her team for the way they've managed their P&L. They've been conscious about moving more of their investment into R&D. You saw a record number of 20 plus new product launches last year that are considered meaningful. We're going to be very close to probably a very similar number this year. And so that portfolio has taken very much the same approach that I would say Pharmaceuticals did almost a decade ago when the focus is very well understood and where we want to play because we've got a strategic or competitive advantage will be capitalized upon. I don't know Ashley if you want to add anything more but I think that certainly there is continued support but a lot of the credit goes to Ashley and her team in terms of managing their levels of investment throughout the P&L.I would maybe underscore too is that gives us the confidence to go out and add in inorganic opportunities when the opportunity presents itself using the criteria of strategic fit as well as financial value creation. So a stronger internal pipeline that gets hopefully success out in the acquisition markets.Thanks. Jennifer. Thibaut maybe give some insight too on the consumer segment and how COVID is impacting. Obviously it was much more tumultuous I'd say in 2020 and 2021. But what are you seeing to the early start of this year?And Geoff with respect to cash flow and M&A I think I'll answer that in two parts. I think short term we certainly have the credit rating to warrant more firepower should we need it. As you have observed our cash flow generation over the last couple of years has ticked up to new levels north of $20 billion or around $20 billion from when we were just maybe $17 billion a few years ago. As the consumer company operates I think that's going to be actually liberating for both sides. We still have opportunities to improve our cash flow with inventory management and receivables. But as we move to a higher growth segment we think we'll be able to generate similar cash flow with a higher level of sales growth managing the P&L appropriately. So I've got every confidence that we'll be able to do small medium and large scale acquisitions should the right opportunity present itself. I also think it's liberating for the Consumer Health segment because they'll be able to focus their cash flow generation to value-creating opportunities through their particular lens being fit for purpose in a digitized environment that Thibaut spoke to. So whether it's near-term or long-term I think we're in a very good position to utilize today's cash and hopefully that which should we generate tomorrow. Kevin maybe we've got time for one more question?Great. Thanks Jess. And as Jess alluded to we certainly do appreciate your questions and the chance to interact with you. I'd like to remind everybody as we close that we do have the opportunity to engage with shareholders at next week's annual meeting on April 28. Also be on the lookout for an update on our commitments to ESG. On June 8 we will be issuing our Health for Humanity Report which is an in-depth review on the progress we are making on our 2025 goals. Thank you for your time and your interest in Johnson & Johnson. Have a great day.,0.003446718,0.003864765,0.000451316
8,8,XOM,Woods:,Yes. And I would just add to that Sam if you look at the work we've been doing with our organization the changes that we've made in the structure the consolidation of capabilities across the corporation. One of the changes we announced on April 1 was a technology organization that combines the technical skills and capabilities and the engineering capabilities across the corporation. We've seen really good results doing that in the projects area. We think we've got a real opportunity in the technology area to realize similar benefits in terms of effectiveness on top of whatever efficiencies that might come from that work. And I would say that effectiveness in that concentration of technology and really getting the organization to focus on where we can add unique value and grow competitive advantage is going to be a really important part of continuing to be a valued partner with NOCs and others all around the world. Now our strategy here is to make sure that we're in a central partner that when NOCs and other resource holders are -- or want somebody who can effectively and efficiently develop the resource and doing in a sustainable manner that the first name to come to mind is ExxonMobil and then we bring those unique capabilities. And I would tell you I have enormous confidence that that's what's going to happen. Things that we can see in the pipeline the opportunities that we have in front of us to become more effective at what we do I think are huge and we're looking forward to then leveraging that business opportunities in the future.Yes. I'll just start off and then pass it to Kathy for any additional comments but I would -- I think the short answer is no. I think we have tried to emphasize looking through the cycles looking at the long term and making sure that the investments that we make are robust to the whole of the cycle. You remember we were investing pretty heavily when prices were down in anticipation of longer-term fundamentals. I would say while we're in a very tight market today we're not going to let that distract us from our focus of making sure that we have low cost of supply industry-leading advantaged projects. And so that remains the focus. In the short-cycle stuff I think to the extent that we stay within our credibly advantaged approach and the manufacturing processes that we've set in and the boundaries that we set with respect to the facilities that we've built we pre-invested in and we'll continue to optimize around that but we're not going to go outside of that broader strategy of the long ball game that we're playing in the Permian in the interventional space.Yes. I would just add that the action that we announced this morning we're taking won't be material in the analysis that you're doing Paul. Our intention would be to continue to deliver on the efficiency I mean that's a -- that we had projected in our plan.Sure. Lucas just to start on the back end of your question you're right train 1 is -- we expect to start up in 2024 and then the remaining trains in 2025. And what -- the strategic drive behind that investment and that supply point was really getting a global -- a balanced global footprint with respect to LNG supply. So that Golden Pass facility gives us an anchor point within the Americas to take advantage of the U.S. gas market and the developments that we've seen there and the supply potential that we see in U.S. gas. And so that forms a really important anchor supply point. And we intend to use that with the trading business that we're growing in LNG and use it as an ability to trade and oftentimes bridge as some of our other LNG projects are being developed to bridge and supply between those projects that allow us to optimize and make commitments for projects with flexibility in terms of using Golden Pass as a supply point and then to also just trade in the spot market. So I think it's going to give us a lot of flexibility to supplement our longer-term contracts for our bigger projects but to also participate in the spot market.I would tell you that the LNG organization is going to basically develop that portfolio in the way that they think maximizes the value of it. So I wouldn't take anything off the table. I'm just -- I'm suggesting that it's -- we've got a lot of optionality and flexibility and the expectation is the LNG business and the individual running that take advantage of that flexibility to maximize the value that's how I would characterize it.Yes. I would tell you that the plan that we had and we've talked about with respect to the Permian specifically somewhere between 10 and 12 rigs and then frac crew something like that. And we're basically I think in line with that plan right now. And part of that is making sure that we're -- the developments that we're pursuing are consistent with the base infrastructure the technology and the capital efficiency approaches that we've built into that development that tends to drive what we're doing there. I think what -- and Kathy has touched on we again had anticipated the market recovery and some of the tightness and so had developed some contracting strategies and partnering with suppliers to try to mitigate that impact. That's paying off. We're seeing that advantage here in the Permian. Eventually that obviously will roll off. Some of the consumables and some of the labor tight -- tightness that we're seeing in the Permian obviously that's starting to impact us as well. So we are seeing inflationary pressures. The expectation is that will continue to grow as the work activity opens up and as some of the logistics constraints get resolved. And we're basically -- we've challenged the team to try to manage that and to make sure that as we look at progressing development and grow that production that we're doing it in a constructive way and not undermining the cost of supply or the advantaged position of those barrels where they sit in the supply -- cost of supply curve for the industry. So I think we're going to -- this disciplined approach that we've talked about is not so much a spend but in terms of efficiency and making sure that everything -- that every dollar we spend there is productive. And the challenge for that team is to make sure we don't lose productivity of the capital that we're spending.,0.00345089,0.004216135,0.000561813
9,9,JPM,Dimon:,Mike I would just add if you look at liquidity and capital it's extraordinary. And we don't want to have buffers on top of buffers. So we're going to manage this pretty tightly over time. And obviously when you have AOCI and earnings and CECL all that but being conscious of all of that we can manage through that. And we've done some acquisitions this year. And so -- and plus we are adding -- we're planning to have more capital for the increase in G-SIFI down the road which reduced stock buyback and -- but the amount -- I look at the amount of liquidity the earnings the capital that's the stuff that really matters. And at the end of the day it's driving customers. We serve customers which is why we're here. We don't serve managing SLR. That's kind of an output of stuff we do. And so -- and then your question about -- I think it was about recession basically. Yes do you want to repeat the question?Yes I don't. But I just want to question this. First of all I can't forecast the future any more than anyone else. And the Fed forecasted and everyone forecasted and everyone's wrong all the time and I think it's a mistake. We run the company to serve clients through thick or thin. That's what we do. We know there will be ups. We know there will be down. We know the weather is going to change and all that stuff like that. What I have pointed out in my letter is very strong underlying growth right now which will go on. It's not stoppable. The consumer has money. They pay down credit card debt. Confidence isn't high but the fact that they have money they're spending their money. They have $2 trillion still in their savings and checking accounts business are in good shape. Home prices are up. Credit is extraordinarily good. So you have this -- that's one factor. That's going to continue in the second quarter third quarter. And I -- after that it's hard to predict. You've got two other very large countervailing factors which you guys are all completely aware of. One is inflation/QE/QT. You've never seen that before. I'm simply pointing out that we've -- those are storm clouds on the horizon that may disappear they may not. That's a fact. And I'm quite conscious of that fact and I do expect that alone will create volatility and concerns and endless printing and endless headlines and stuff like that. And the second is war in Ukraine. I pointed out in my letter that war in Ukraine. Usually wars don't necessarily affect the global economy in the short run. But there are exceptions to that. This may very well be one of them. I don't -- I'm not looking at this on a static basis. Okay? So you're looking at this war in Ukraine and sanctions. Things are unpredictable. Wars are unpredictable. Wars have unpredictable outcome. You've already seen in oil markets. The oil markets are precarious. Okay? So I pointed that out over and over that people don't understand that those things can change dramatically for either physical reasons cyber reasons or just supply-demand. And so that's another huge cloud in the horizon and I -- we're prepared for it. We understand it. We're just -- I can't tell you the outcome of it. I hope those things all disappear and go away. We have a soft landing and the Board is resolved. Okay? I just wouldn't bet on all that. I just -- and of course being a risk manager we're going to get through all that. We're going to serve our clients and we're going to gain share. We're going to come to that earning tremendous returns on capital like we have in the past.We've already told you we're helping our clients get through this. We had a little bit lost this quarter but we manage through it. Weâ€™ll do postmortems on both what we think we did wrong and what the LME could do differently later. We're not going to do it now.In my life I've seen so many 10 standard deviation events [indiscernible]. Obviously we're aware of that all the time in everything we do.So we do CCAR once a year as you guys see. But we actually run 100 different various stress tests every week with extreme movements and things. And that's what we do. And we're always -- you're always going to be a little surprise somewhere but we're pretty conscious of those risks. And all events like this we always look at -- but it doesn't have to happen to us. It can happen to someone else. We still analyze everything that maybe we were on the wrong side of something too. But at the end of the day in all of our businesses we are here to serve clients all the time. That means taking rational thoughtful disciplined risk to do that.Guys we're just talking about interest rates going up maybe more than 3%. Convexity is going up. AOCI is going up all these -- there are all these various reasons not to do that. We're not going to do it just to give you a little bit more NII next quarter.And I'll just add to that. I cannot foresee any scenario at all where you're not going to have a lot of volatility in markets going forward. We've already spoken about the enormous strength of the economy QT inflation war commodity prices there's almost no chance that you want to have volatile markets. That could be good or bad for trading but some [indiscernible] change won't happen. And I think people should be prepared for that.Yes in general because as people are spending money and you need to produce more goods and all that yes and generally see CapEx going up. And I forgot the exact number. You better off looking at our great accounting forecast -- than asking me. And we see in the borrowing a little bitâ€¦It's very hard to tell. There was some improvement and then there was Ukraine. And now it's all mixed again. So it's hard to tell.We'll leave that to Investor Day.Well thank you very much.See you I guess at Investor Day.Okay. Goodbye.,0.002712568,0.002960384,0.000232042

11,11,V,Prabhu:,Yes. I mean going back to your question about shareholders and returning cash to shareholders we did step up our dividend. It's $1.50 per quarter now. We did that last quarter. And then as you saw we accelerated our stock buybacks. Our stock buyback is programmatic but when we see opportunities we step it up. And clearly our cash flows are better. We felt there was an opportunity and we stepped up. As Al said I mean our first priority is investing in our core business. There's plenty of opportunity here for growth. Second would be acquisitions that enhance our capabilities like Currencycloud and hopefully soon we close on Tink. And then of course we've always been returning cash to shareholders most of our free cash flow in the form of dividends and buybacks.Sure. In terms of inflation as it relates to our revenues as you know our service fees cross-border et cetera are denominated primarily in basis points on ticket size. So to the extent that there's inflation driving up ticket size clearly it's beneficial to us. When it comes to transactions processing our fees are generally tried to number of transactions. Right now of course the size of the basket has gone up. Some of it is because of inflation. Some of it is because it's just gone up through the pandemic. Some of it has to do with the fact that some of the smaller transactions you've got in a normal world like people going and buying themselves lunch at work or a cup of coffee. We're losing some of those transits. And so that causes ticket size on a mix basis to go up which will recover and that will be good for our transactions business. And in general when people are ordering in through e-commerce basket sizes have tended to go up. So the basket size increase we see now it's partially inflation partially it's some elements like the ones I just went through. So net-net I mean we are a beneficiary of inflation. And in terms of wage inflation generally speaking I mean we expect some everybody is seeing it. But overall I mean it's reasonable at this point and we'll update you as time goes by if it's more than we expected. Al I'm sure you have things to add.Going back to your second question on cross-border I think what's become evident from multiple data points over the last six to nine months is that when borders open it's like a switch turning on the reaction is almost immediate. There's massive pent-up demand and consumers are quick to act. And what we saw in October and November was really the world opening up ex-China. And if it hadn't been for Omicron that trend was quite extraordinary. Between September and November we saw a very steep increase in cross-border travel driven by the opening of the U.S. border the opening up of most borders in Europe. And what we started to see in October was many Asian countries which have been the most restrictive excluding China of course either open up or announce a timetable for opening up. So that tells you that opening borders which is something that is hard to predict because governments control it can have a sizable and immediate impact. In terms of your question as to what is our assumption our assumption is for steady improvement through the year. But we know it won't be steady. I mean there will be periods when borders open and we could see some sharp improvements. And there may be occasional periods where if there is another variant there may be some flattening out just as we saw in January. But the bottom line is it is very clear that when borders are open things will move very fast to normalize.Well I think the short answer is we fully expect to get back to pre-COVID trend levels meaning whatever the trend line was we will get back to that trend line. And at least initially the mix will be a little different because the part of the business that is growing well above trend is the cross-border business that right now is below trend -- below the trend line is the travel business. The e-commerce business cross-border is clearly one that we think can sustain above trend growth rates relative to pre-COVID. And if the travel business returns only to the pre-COVID growth rates which we see no reason why it wouldn't so let's assume it grows above pre-COVID growth rates gets to the trend line and then begins to grow at pre-COVID trend rates. We see no reason why that isn't the case. There is a possibility because of the e-commerce business that the cross-border business in total can grow faster than pre-COVID growth rates after it gets back to the pre-COVID trend line. I assume that is sort of what you were asking.Yes. You're right Tien-Tsin. I mean the cross-border outperformance in the first quarter was primarily cross-border but we also had value-added services performing quite a bit better than we expected. So strong value-add service was also a contributor. So those would be the sort of the two main drivers. As you know we service -- when payments volumes outperform we booked the revenue with a lag. There was outperformance on payments volumes too but that doesn't show up in the quarter. It certainly wasn't anywhere on the order of magnitude as our cross-border performance but there was there's definitely. There would have been higher service revenues had there been no lag. The other part of your question was...Rebates and incentives yes we have been saying for a while that those numbers were going up because of the mix change away from cross-border. We thought coming into this quarter that we'd be somewhere in the region of 26% at the low end of the prior range we had. We were a whole point lower entirely because our mix improved because of cross-border and the reduction in the range for the year is also driven by the improvement in the mix since we now expect the cross-border business to be stronger than we had originally expected.Yes. I mean we don't sort of -- no one corridor accounts for a big chunk of our volume. So China opening or not don't have to make specific assumptions on that. We certainly expect some opening in Asia. The big surprise in October before Omicron hit was Asia was opening up faster than we expected. So for example Thailand pretty much opened up all their resorts. Now they did pause but they've reopened them again now that the Omicron wave seems to be passing. We saw Singapore announced a phased opening plan and I believe they're still on track to do that. We even saw Indonesia India ease restrictions. So more kinds of people can travel to India without -- and Indonesia without quarantines and things like that. China is completely shut and it's hard to predict when it opens. So I would say on balance we are not counting on a big recovery of the Chinese business. But otherwise the big swing factor at this point is how quickly Asia opens and how restrictive is it after opening.Yes I can start and I'm sure Al will add. I mean look in the short run the cyclical recovery is by far the biggest driver of the growth. Having said that I mean underneath the cyclical recovery which is most acute right now in cross-border you can see that other components of the business are not only stable but also growing at an above trend level. So if you look at our payments volumes. Credit is in a recovery mode but debit is very resilient even as credit recovers and is at a growth rate if you do a CAGR over the time period pre-pandemic it's a higher CAGR than it was pre-pandemic. The same is true for e-commerce growth. You could say the same about our value-added services and new flows. So while the biggest driver of short-term growth being above trend is the recovery component. If you look below it the underlying sustainable and secular growth trends are also about trend relative to where they were pre-pandemic.,0.00347878,0.004947722,0.000917457
12,12,AVGO,Tan:,Thatâ€™s an interesting thing Ed. Here all our businesses â€“ I just want to remind you in our view as I said in the view of all semiconductor segments itself itâ€™s not a high-growth business. You guys like to think because probably there are a few companies out there who are trying to grow in a business that doesnâ€™t grow. 5% is what it is. And so itâ€™s a business that does grow but in dollar terms overall mid-single digits. I call it a slow growth industry. Within it however it still evolves new generation of products constantly. Thatâ€™s the unusual unique thing about semiconductors. It keeps evolving. Not disruptive much as people like to say they are disruptive. My view is evolutionary but that evolutionary creates new opportunities for basically selling a better product a more valuable product to the same customer for the similar application and it go â€“ which the customer can then monetize back on their own. And thatâ€™s really all it is. And what we are doing here in wireless is no different. And there is something also very interesting. Every product we sell in wireless is in fact a non-standard product. It is customized. It is customized for the needs â€“ for the unique needs and particular requirements of that particular customer. Thatâ€™s what makes us so successful and thatâ€™s what makes the partnership so sustainable. We developed technology in the form of products that we do whether itâ€™s an RF with FBAR front-end module or whether itâ€™s pure silicon with some SDK â€“ a lot of SDK software where some unique high performance mixed signal analog product all of which we do to this customer we do it to meet their particular requirements which allow their products to be at a level thatâ€™s very differentiated from their own space â€“ in the competitive space they are in. And thatâ€™s what makes it very unique and thatâ€™s what makes this thing keep going. But weâ€™re not looking for in any end market we are in in any product line we are in for high growth. High growth in semiconductor comes in spurts and do not last. If anybody tells you otherwise please donâ€™t believe it because it has never happened.Okay. The next 12 months is pretty good. We have visibility and we kind of indicated that in our answers. 24 months harder for me to tell you. If you ask me what do you think over the next 10 years Iâ€™ll tell you what it is mid to high-single digits. And because thatâ€™s â€“ itâ€™s consistent. There is no segment â€“ donâ€™t believe anybody telling otherwise that will have a sustainable growth rate in this space. Itâ€™s share changes maybe. So but next 12 months very good growth rate is what I indicated.To tell you I donâ€™t have a strategic plan here. My plan are a numbers plan. Itâ€™s â€“ our strategy in acquisitions and growing this entire Broadcom platform is more about locating identifying very very strong assets out there and â€“ which are actionable and then making a deal and buying them and integrating in our platform. They got to meet our requirements of quality of the assets of the product â€“ of the business model to some extent the product characteristics being very mission-critical. And then after that comes the price. For us after that is the price. Because youâ€™ll recall the way we run those software businesses tends to be different usually from the way the party we buy from Transit. And because of that we are able to create the financial returns consistent with a business model that we put in place fairly different from what the existing business model is in most software companies out there.

13,13,MA,Mehra:,"Yes. Rayna happy to take that question. So look I mean at the end of the day you know that the business as we have it is a high operating leverage business right? At the end of the day incremental dollars of revenue typically flow to the bottom line just given the nature of how we operate. So certainly cross-border recovery is playing into the recovery in operating margins but it's not just about cross-border. It's about overall strong consumer spending and cross-border travel recovery all of which is contributing to the delivery of improved operating margins. Helping that even further is the good new strength in our services and everything we're doing along those parts. So it's everything which we are doing in terms of driving the fundamentals of our business back to the strategic priorities Michael was talking about which is growing our payments keeping on leaning in on services and then continue to invest in the new network space which is really important. So all of those factors are contributing factors to the expanding operating margins that you're seeing come through. The message I'd like to leave you with on this is the following: We continue to run the business for long-term sustainable growth which means effectively that we're going to continue to invest in a disciplined manner to ensure that we are creating the right opportunities for ourselves to deliver this long-term top line growth. And while we do that you should see the impact of that come through in terms of operating margins.Thanks Aaron. I'll take the first part and then Michael will address your second question. I guess the headline is the following which is we're not seeing anything fundamentally changed in terms of the profile of our cross-border revenues. I mean net-net things are going to move around depending on how much cross-border comes from intra-Europe versus volumes from outside of that intra-Europe corridor because as you know intra-Europe is lower yielding and then other cross-border volumes are higher yielding. But fundamentally I would tell you not much has changed. I will make one point. You talked about rebates and incentives not being there with cross-border. I would say that there's a lower indexation of rebates and incentives to cross-border. There's always been some level of rebates incentives which have been associated with cross-border not nearly as high as what's there in the domestic volume environment. But we're not seeing fundamentally much change in that regard.And I'll just add Michael a couple of thoughts on Brazil. One you asked the question about the strong growth. Clearly it's a combination of the macro environment but it's also the fact that we've been leaning in pretty heavily with our traditional issuers as well as our fintech partners in that space which has been part of the reason why we've been seeing some of that growth come through in a decent manner Lisa. The second point I'd make tying back to Michael's comments around PICCs [ph] the market has to be bifurcated in the context of both debit and credit. And on the credit side we continue to see tremendous growth. PICCs -- which Michael said is primarily catering to P2P and B2B flows even if it were to actually proliferate a little bit into call it the smaller merchants from a P2M standpoint were primarily be focused around the debit side of the equation and so credit still remains the mainstay for us in Brazil as it stands.Thanks Tien-Tsin. So everything we kind of talked about and Michael talked about earlier on in this conversation was about our expanding relationships with these issuers. And so with these issuers we are gaining share. That's kind of the reality of the situation. Again there are puts and takes in the market right? So as I think about the new relationship well I should say new relationship the expanded relationship we have with Wells right that's an increasing share position with Wells which is taking place for example there. So the bottom line is the following which is whether it's Wells Capital One what we're doing with Santander and NatWest Deutsche -- you name it the GAAP portfolio all of these incrementally are helping us drive our volumes. From a holistic market standpoint again like I said there are puts and takes right? But we're very very optimistic about how we are seeing business translate for us. And as we mentioned at the Investor Community Day we are growing market share across all regions and the market share growth which we've seen in 16 of our top 20 markets which is something we shared with you at the Investor Community Day is really the data points we put out so far.Sure David. So I think you're touching upon a couple of things which are there on that card-not-present ex travel. The reality is as cross-border travel comes back you do see some give back in terms of cross-border card not travel -- card-not-present ex travel. That's a mouthful. So the point is at the end of the day right there are a few factors you got to take into consideration when you're thinking about future growth rates for cross-border card-not-present ex-travel. Number one what's the pace of recovery on cross-border travel is going to be. Number two what the prior year comps were on cross-border card-not-present ex-travel? Because remember these growth rates are all influenced by prior comps as well. And what was happening in the COVID environment last year which might have caused for elevated levels of cross-border card-not-present ex-travel. And number three you do see fluctuations come in that number through as a result of crypto and crypto volumes right? And so these three factors are kind of things you've got to take into consideration. The point at an up level is the following which is the consumer continues to spend in an omnichannel manner. When they can get out and spend in a physical environment they do that when they can't spend in a card-not-present environment they do that. We are ready to support them in both manners whether it's through our omnichannel capabilities that we're offering our merchants and the strength which we're seeing in card-not-present ex-travel from a cross-border standpoint is something we expect that strength to actually stay going forward as well. There might be puts and takes for all the reasons I just mentioned but largely I think consumer behavior has changed in a manner where they've gone more digital and you're going to see some strength come through out there.Sure Bryan. So first I'll take your question on Russia and what we're assuming. So we have suspended operations in Russia as a result of which we're not earning any revenues related to Russian issued cards. So as it relates to revenue for the rest of the year we had mentioned that we had put out an 8-K about how Russia represented roughly 4% of our revenues in 2021. And so we've assumed that that 4% doesn't exist in any of the quarters going forward from a net revenue standpoint right? Point number two. And again like I said in my prepared remarks there's some level of headwind which we're assuming in Ukraine as well. But the reality is that's a little bit of an uncertainty just because we're not entirely sure as to how the war in Ukraine evolves and what the implications of that are. So we built in some assumptions and that's what we've kind of given you in our overall thoughts. From an expense standpoint the Russia-related expenses represented roughly 2% of our operating expenses. And again from an OpEx growth standpoint kind of that's the way we think about it. As I mentioned we have taken down when we've shared with you our thoughts for full year 2022 we have taken down our OpEx growth rate on an ex-acquisition currency-neutral basis to reflect that very impact from a Russia standpoint.Yes. So Dan there's nothing fundamentally which is really changing as it relates to our debit business. I'll put that out there in the first place. Growth rates obviously are impacted by comps. I think you get that piece. I think you've got to take into consideration that there is a one portfolio which is a debit portfolio which is rolling off in the U.S. which was previously announced which is probably impacting that comparative analysis that you're seeing because obviously we're seeing the detriment of that comes through in our debit metrics and that primarily started in the recent past and will go on through the course of this year. And the competitor is likely actually getting the benefit of that. So that's probably the reason you're seeing some of the divergence.And I'll just add some â€“ a little bit more color on that just because I think it's important for you as you're thinking about your models going forward to actually factor this in. When we talk about Russia revenues there are a few things from a Russia revenue standpoint which you might want to take into consideration one of which relates to the fact that Services was well penetrated in the Russia and Ukraine markets and had strong growth. And so as you think about the model and the impacts across the different line items you're going to see impact related to lost services revenue come through in other revenues in the ensuing quarters. That's kind of point number one. Few other salient pieces on Russia-related revenues as you think about the different line items. Yes we will lose the volumes and transactions. Russia was a fast-growing market. It has no average ticket size which I kind of mentioned earlier. There's a high degree of contactless penetration. Again I think these are important things where you want to kind of keep in mind as you think about comps on a going-forward basis. And the cross-border issuing out of Russia was mostly higher yielding into regional cross-border issuing. Also strong remittances and disbursements market. Why am I sharing all of this with you? Because as you think about the various metrics we've shared across all of these aspects those will get impacted as Russia starts coming into play in future quarters.Yes. So George I called it out because Q1 had unusually high foreign exchange volatility. I mean the reality is we don't typically talk about this because these numbers kind of go back and forth from a volatility standpoint but there was unusually high FX volatility in Q1. The outlook from a going forward standpoint is really hard to say. I mean this is one of those things where I guess as Michael jokes with me """"Sachin you wouldn't be doing the job if you knew where volatility was going on a forward basis for foreign exchange."""" So the point is at the end of the day we've taken our best assumptions on a holistic basis for our business share with you what our thoughts are from a full year and a Q2 basis on net revenue. Very hard to predict what the outlook going forward is going to be. Unusually high volatility does help us. The other thing to keep in mind is since it's related to cross-border volumes as to for volumes come back that combined with unusually high volatility has that much more of an impact.Jason as I mentioned we're assuming improving trends vis-Ã -vis compared to 2019 as we go forward. We're not sharing a specific number for what that looks like in the second quarter or the end of the year. We've built in our expectations in terms of the revenue guidance I've shared with you our thoughts around how that trend takes place. The combination of that was consumer spending and what the improving trajectory in consumer spending is it's all factored into the numbers.So think I mentioned to you on rebates and incentives is the following which is we have a rich pipeline of deals. We continue to execute on that as you heard from Michael in terms of some of the wins which we had recently. Obviously you get the benefit of improving cross-border trends to play through in terms of lower amounts of business incentives impacting that. And the last point I'll make on rebate and incentive is in Q1 we had this onetime benefit relating to the non-renewal of our Russian customer agreement which you should not expect the benefit of that to come through on a going-forward basis. So net-net I would tell you that a lot of this is going to be dependent on what the timing of deals are? How we put those new into deals into play? And what the recovery of cross-border is going to be.",0.002788246,0.003151357,0.000187325
14,14,HD,McPhail:,Generally speaking we are excited about what we are building out in terms of capability and our ability to go after the repair and remodeler planned purchase occasions that we havenâ€™t necessarily been able to in the past. But when you start thinking about contribution to results we are building an ecosystem here for the Pro. Itâ€™s not just about fulfillment and delivery. Itâ€™s about an online experience that we think is second to none thatâ€™s seen incredible traction over the very short-term. We have a relationship with our Pros in the store that we think is second to none. And Hector I will turn it to you for a second with some detail. But again with respect to results we are quite pleased that we grew by $40 billion over the last 2 years. We were really pleased that we were able to comp the comp and enter into a second quarter so far with two strong weeks. And I think over the coming years you are going to see every element of our model add up to our ability to take market share in any environment. But Hector maybe you will talk a little bit about the Pro.I think just to the TAM point we talk about the 130 million households in the U.S. about 30 million of those households actually occupy multifamily dwellings. And so that HD Supply acquisition opened up that TAM for us and is a unique attribute of The Home Depot.Sure. So for the year we believe that gross margin if you just sort of stay mix-neutral gross margin will see slight pressure from the investments we are making in One Supply Chain. Those have been planned all year and we have expected that for a while. With respect to operating expense leverage as we have taken our sales guidance up we have also raised our operating margin guidance. That reflects the operating expense leverage we expect to generate on those incremental sales. With respect to ticket and transaction we assume that comps in the back half are positive. If inflation persists for the year persist at current levels we expect ticket could be in the range of 10% to 12% for the year offset by transactions to net out to a three comp for the year.So first of all we are â€“ we took steps as Ted had said earlier in the call to invest in improving our in-stock position. And while we are not â€“ we are quite where we were pre-pandemic we are the healthiest we have been in the last few years. So if you think about sort of that pull-forward of inventory making sure that we landed inventory early because in this business customer service starts with being in-stock. And you also consider the impact of a late spring. That really makes up about half of the increase in inventory and the other half is simply the impact of inflation. So as we think about this through the year obviously we are â€“ as spring kicks in we will see that inventory begin to reflect the seasonality. And we work hard. Our merchants and our supply chain team and our vendor partners work hard to make sure that we have an advantaged position.Well we really just have to look at the health of our customer today which is strong. And we also have to listen to our customers those same surveys where the Pro survey there is also one with respect to consumer intent to do projects. Homeowner intent to do projects of small medium and large sizes has never been higher than right now.Well with respect to capital allocation we generated strong free cash flow and so have returned significant capital to shareholders over the last decade-plus. With respect to CapEx and investment in the business we take a long-term view. We are always going to invest ahead of the customer. We are always looking years ahead to make sure that we build the best customer experience in home improvement. And so that would likely be our stance. But we always have to take circumstances into consideration and we do that in any event.Itâ€™s early. What I would say is we do expect Q2 to be the highest-comp quarter of the year. And expect the first half to be higher than the second half but we do expect positive comps through the year.,0.017763823,0.032080352,0.014316529
15,15,CVX,Wirth:,Yes. So in the first quarter we had a little bit at Gorgon from some of the things that we had talked about earlier. So some discovery work that was proactive not related to an incident but it was asset integrity work across all 3 trains. A little bit of that came into the first quarter of this year. Wheatstone has a turnaround underway right now of one of the 2 trains and also the offshore platform and some common facilities which that requires both trains to come down when you take the offshore and common facilities down. The good news is that part of the turnover is behind us right now. And we're in the process of resuming production at one of the 2 trains there at Wheatstone and should have first LNG any day now. And actually the second trend will be early May. So we're nearly through that turnaround. Then we also have a turnaround in -- at Angola LNG. And so that will be in the second quarter late in the second quarter and that's really what we've got planned for this year. Second quarter takes all the planned turnaround activity essentially or the majority of it.Yes. I'll take a pass but Pierre might want to add something. Look we see this in our downstream business. We're a little bit differently positioned than some of our peers in that we've got pretty heavy U.S. West Coast exposure and heavy Asia exposure but then we're pretty light in the Middle East or Europe and some of the other basins. So our portfolio is a little concentrated more so than others. And so -- we're subject to the dynamics in those markets. China has been in a lot of kind of ongoing lockdowns. California frankly has had a little more aggressive COVID policy longer than some other parts of the world. And so demand has reflected that to a certain degree. And then in a rising crude market we have 2 effects that tend to roll through our downstream. One is just the way our inventory is valued and so in a rising market we tend to see inventory -- negative inventory effects due to the LIFO accounting that we use. And we also tend to see -- we're long physical and short paper as we try not to take price exposure. But that paper marks to market until the physical closes. And so in a rising market your papers marking negative the physical obviously is gaining. And so you see that paper and then the physical deliveries you close out the paper and you match those up. So in a rising market those 2 effects tend to cause negatives. I think in the second quarter of this year we'll probably see a lot of that reverse.Yes. So -- yes you want to handle that Pierre? Go ahead.And you're right Manav. It was late March when it came up. So the effect is really in the month of April.Yes Manav. We -- obviously aviation demand is going to grow as we go forward. And finding a solution it's one of the hardest to decarbonize segments of the economy because you need to have high energy density for aviation fuels or planes can't carry much in terms of their cargo. So it's an area of focus. In a traditional refinery the distillate portion of the barrel you can move molecules from diesel to kerosene or jet fuel. And the renewable diesel investments that we're making there's a certain flexibility that you have there as well. And so we will have the ability to produce. In fact we've already produced some sustainable aviation fuel at El Segundo. And we'll see more of that coming through some of our renewable diesel facilities. We have also get negotiations underway with some other companies that have different technologies that wouldn't necessarily be the same as what we would do in a refinery. And so we're looking at alternate pathways feedstock partnerships and pathways. This is all going to take time to come together. Quality control is really important in aviation fuels reliability of supply is really important. And as we introduce new feedstocks new technology pathways you have to be really diligent in ensuring that the fuel that you ultimately produce and sell is going to perform in the engines that it's going to be consumed into. The last thing I'll say is none of this stuff is inexpensive. And sustainable aviation fuel today is not competitive with traditional aviation fuel from a cost standpoint. There has been some talk in Washington about various policy incentives that could be put into place to encourage more sustainable aviation fuel. There's a letter that was published by a whole host of people airlines and others just in the last week or so calling for action. And I think to see this scale we got to keep working on technology in feedstocks but it's likely that some sort of policy incentives will be part of the equation in order to see more capital drawn into sustainable aviation fuel.Sure. So pre invasion CPC discounts were maybe $1 or so to dated Brent. Post invasion the trading range has kind of been $4 to $10 net prices at a pricing point called Augusta which includes insurance and freight. So yes there's been a move. It's call it $7 or $8 today probably. Now absolute price obviously has moved up a lot more than that. But there's a little bit that you could argue as being left on the table. I think a lot of it Doug depends on how things are resolved in Ukraine and what the longer-term posture is relative to sanctions the perceived risk of lifting at Novvi resis and how that translates into demand from customers and the expectations from shipowners and whether it's freight rates insurance et cetera are people willing to send ships back in there the way they historically have or not. So it's a hypothetical. I think that I can't really speculate on how that settles out. But I think it's a function of how this whole situation is resolved and what kind of risks people perceive on the other side of the conflict resolution.Yes Doug I appreciate the comments about our M&A track record and our financial strength. Those are 2 things that we've worked hard to establish. I'll tell you we like our portfolio. We've provided again I think in this year's Investor Day a 10-year outlook that says how much resource have we captured and could conceivably flow into production not that that's a production to forecast but it's really a look at resource depth. We've talked a little bit today about gas. We're a little oilier than most. And so over time can we increase some of our gas exposure would be one question. We like petrochemicals. We like CPChem a lot. We've got a big chemicals business embedded in Korea in Genus Caltex. The growth prospects in the petrochemicals business continue to look attractive. And then we've been active in new energies. And so the renewable fuels business that we talked about some other things that we're looking at in that space as well. And so look we're trying to leverage our strengths to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. And I think that drives the way we think about our portfolio today and tomorrow. And a number of things I mentioned there right are lower carbon contributions to economic growth and prosperity. So and -- that would be how we think about it. But I don't want to leave the impression that we're off to the races to do anything tomorrow because we like our portfolio as it sits today and don't feel like there's a hole that has to be filled in the short term. So we really can take a long-term look. We can be patient. We can be selective if we decide to do anything.Okay. LNG turnarounds were typically at a 4-year turnaround cycle. So what that means is that Gorgon with 3 trains you'll have 3 out of the 4 years you'll have 1 turnaround. At Wheatstone with 2 trains 2 out of every 4 years you'll see a turnaround. And at Angola LNG where we've got a single train 1 out of every 4 years you'll see a turnaround. On government discussions it's just early Jason to say. I don't think anybody's really fully adapted or no one knows what the environment is likely to look like a year from now 2 years from now 5 years from now. So I think that's one that is a work in progress.Yes. I'll -- Biraj I'll take the second one and then Pierre has been spending a lot of time with investors and I'm going to let him talk to you about whether the market is signaling we ought to change our capital spend. On TCO we just had a pretty extensive update on the project here. Week before last we made good progress through the winter. We're close to having our annual cost and schedule update done. But the high-level message on that is we look pretty good on budget still. We look good on the schedule for the future growth project which is slated up -- slated to start up in the first half of '24. A little bit of pressure on WPMP which I believe our last update on that was second half '23 late '23. So cost and schedule despite the challenges of COVID and the other kind of regional uncertainties still holding well. The project team there is doing an excellent job. So I think Jay will be on the second quarter call and can give you a more complete run down on things. We will have all these costs and schedule reviews completed but nothing there that signals a significant change. Pierre maybe you can talk about signals from the market on capital?,0.00467447,0.006321967,0.001506361
16,16,MRK,Davis:,"Great. Chris thanks for the question. Yes on the BD landscape question the short answer is we are not seeing a fundamental shift in seller expectations as of this point. I think as time continues if we see the market reset to become more permanent and more importantly if the IPO market continues to be challenged for biotech companies that might change over time as companies become more cash constrained. There are some smaller players that do have cash challenges. So I think that's where you could see movement first. But fundamentally we've not seen a change in the landscape yet. We'll have to continue to watch. With regards to the Animal Health business our view continues to be that the Animal Health business as you said is core to the Company. It's core to our strategy as part of a growth driver for the Company. But as we've always said we look at this regularly. We always are challenging ourselves to ask what is the long-term value creation opportunity of this business in our hands relative to what would be outside of the Company? And on a long-term view we continue to believe it is best in our hands as part of the Company. But if that situation evolves we obviously will continue to be objective in how we analyze that. But we do not look at the short-term the arbitrage opportunity for us. It's more about the long-term value creation and that has not changed as of now.Yes. So Chris this is Rob. Maybe I'll take the first part of the question then Caroline can jump in for the second part. On the strength of the growth we're seeing in the United States this is really a testament to what we've been talking about all along which is as we continue to roll out new indications we are continuing to see our share grow as the leading I-O agent. And importantly I would highlight that the growth we saw among other things in the quarter continuation of our position in renal cell carcinoma continuation of the growth we're seeing in head and neck. In RCC obviously being a first-line treatment in the metastatic setting as well as now having adjuvant therapy as well we've covered pretty much the waterfront of RCC and we have the opportunity to continue to grow there. But the standout frankly for the quarter and it's I think really important to understand is triple-negative breast cancer both in the metastatic setting and in the adjuvant setting. We are seeing incredible growth in that space and it's something that we feel very proud of because I think we're going to have a meaningful difference there. The reason I highlight that is both -- if you look at the adjuvant opportunity there and the growth we're getting as well as I mentioned in adjuvant RCC I think it just reinforces what we see as the future which is the growth contribution from the earlier lines of therapy long term. But with that maybe Caroline can be specific to some of the guidance we've provided.Yes. I'll let Caroline maybe address this.Well just let me say thank you for your time and your interest today. And I'd just like to conclude by again thanking the Merck team globally for their focus and commitment and really in driving the results you've heard about today but continuing to ensure when we keep the purpose of the Company front and center which is to deliver for patients. Hopefully you get the sense we are very confident in the business momentum we have. And I'd like to say as well we are feeling better and better about the evolution of our pipeline and things you've heard today we're starting to expand. We're doing all of the things we need to do. We have more to do but we're making great progress. And that's why I have such confidence in the sustainability of our business long term. So we look forward to continuing to share these results with you to deliver for the patients that count on us and in turn bring value to the shareholders. So with that I'd say thank you and have a great day.""",0.002714604,0.00281918,0.000104576

18,18,KO,Quincey:,I mean our approach to pricing I've commented a little bit on it already. Firstly the highest level principle is the brand has to earn the right for pricing. And that is the combination of its activities in marketing in innovation in execution and the investments in the store and of course in RGM to make the packaging and pricing architecture fit the consumers' needs. Obviously what goes into a piece of that puzzle is also the cost environment whether that be commodities marketing logistics et cetera et cetera. And we seek to balance the various challenges using RGM. As I said earlier clearly as we go into reducing consumer purchasing power we need to have affordability as front and center and depending on where you are in the world can take the shape of different packaging but it all becomes about the entry price point to the category not the kind of the higher-end price towards the category. But you balance that out by having -- moving up the price points on other package combinations. It all has to go in the mix. And it is all done with a perspective that not necessarily every single day but in a reasonable time frame the margin structure of the system needs to be sustained. You definitely don't want to get to a point where there's been a substantial cost push through and that has not yet been passed on into the marketplace when any recessionary impact appears. Trying to catch up on pricing in a recessionary environment is very hard. And so we have a bias to action. In the same way we have a bias to invest behind our brands in marketing innovation. We have a bias to keep up with cost pressures as they occur. And that of course leads us to take pricing more or less frequently depending on where you are in the world and I expect to see more of that in the rest of the year.Yes sure. Thanks Carlos. Clearly as part of both our RGM initiatives because the refillable reusable packages tend to give you the opportunity especially in larger sizes have a lower entry price point which is particularly useful in developing and emerging markets. And so you have an intersection of a very important business imperative on affordability and the fact that ultimately a refillable package is less likely to go to waste and has a lower carbon footprint. And so it really complements our world without waste ESG strategy where we're looking to create a circular economy around our packaging material. So the 2 intersect and give us 2 imperatives at both point in the same direction. And so we're very much looking to invest behind refillable packaging making progress in gaining in mix in Latin America also been driving that in parts of Africa. We've even taken to experimenting with returnable glass in the Southwest of the U.S. And so we are very focused on this because it does work for both of these imperatives and so expect to see kind of more focus and more investment behind keeping that up and working with retailers to make it simple for the consumers to get the credits when they return these reusable bottles. So very much an investment focus.Well clearly I mean I've talked about our approach to pricing several times. And that is going to lead to more -- I mean there are going to be more price increases depending on where you are in. I mean there are countries with inflation well into double digits. And you do see multiple price increases during the year as a matter of course when you're in those sorts of circumstances with cost pressures to push through as you seek to sustain margins over time. Let me just address the elasticity question. It has been apparent and other people have commented on less elasticity in recent times as price increases have gone through. I do not expect elasticities to be inelastic going forward. There's a reason you got the name elasticity. And so I fully expect as I commented earlier on inflation generally ends with some pressure somewhere. I expect elasticity to increase at some point in the future. Will that be next quarter? Or will that be next year? I can't give you the answer to that because it's very dependent on some macros and it's probably going to vary by country. But we are very attuned to it which is why I talked about how we are leaning into investing behind our brands so that we earn the right for the price increases so that we can minimize the elasticity and that we keep a sharp eye on affordability which again tends to minimize elasticity if we use RGM well. But as I say if the choice comes down to we think the elasticity is going up or we're going to have to not pass through some cost we're going to err towards taking the price increase rather than not taking the price increase. As I said earlier not seeing the cost go through and arriving at a recession being behind the curve is less desirable than embarking and having to take the hit from a greater elasticity in the short term. And so that's our kind of modus operandi and we will certainly seek to earn the right to take the price increases. We certainly aren't looking to take price increases just because we can. We want to earn them as a brand and we want to make sure we recover the cost over time.Yes. Thanks Robert. This is a very important area for us and our bottling partners. Simply put the idea of connecting these customers is essentially that our retailers particularly the traditional trade and the fragmented trade remembering that on a global basis about half of our sales go to the fragmented trade whether that's from grocery side or fragmented in terms of being away-from-home and [eatery] so about half of the global sales go to that is being able -- that they can order the Cokes they need or the rest of the portfolio that they need they don't have to necessarily wait for the salesperson to turn up. This isn't about replacing the salesperson very far from it. This is about enabling the selling system to be even more effective in that being able to connect with the retailers generate orders. And so very much it's about sales force enablement system such that in the same way that consumers in the developed world can just use their phones to -- with whatever system with whatever app is appropriate to order things and they don't have to go to the store to get them. We see that the bottling system will be able to sell more and very much in the -- where we've implemented these systems where it's a complement to the sales force it has driven extra sales and driven retailer loyalty. And so we think we can see -- and obviously we're very much engaged with the bottling partners to drive the connectivity particularly for the fragmented trade so that they could order whatever they want whenever they want from the Coke portfolio. And that's as true in the rollout as you called out in Latin America. Myccep.com is the same basic idea. It's all about technologically enabling the selling system to be more effective for the retailers.Yes. Laurent looking at the non-retail business of Costa the Express machines the kind of vending digital barista machine had a very strong quarter with transactions growing strongly and we're starting -- and we're seeing -- now that reopenings have occurred we're starting to see the focus on placement of new machines across Europe and the Middle East; and also in China although that's got a little harder in the last couple of months. But the Express machine is still doing very well. Obviously they need the opening of the world to happen. And then on the Proud to Serve front which is kind of providing the beans and machines to independent outlets starting to ramp that up more in the Europe. Europe environment again early days. We did launch some tests in at-home. That's too early to kind of call. And then Costa ready-to-drink has done pretty well in China. It's sustained its #2 position. It's continuing to grow and we've launched it also in some of the European markets. So starting to see those innovations roll out and we'll see how they do in the coming quarters.Yes sure. I mean clearly China is an important market to us. As I said in the script we had a strong start to the year going into Chinese New Year. But the lockdowns particularly Shanghai took the steam out of things and we ended the quarter negative. It's -- the key factor will be the degree of mobility. And we had -- and depending on how big that is will make a huge difference to the level of results. I don't think there's anything to call from the early days of April that's different to what was happening at the back end of March. The lockdowns as you can read in the newspapers are still in full force so to speak in those cities where they're locking down. And I think that's going to remain the biggest factor. Of course we're going to focus on what we can control. We certainly had 2 years of trying to look at what that looked like over the last couple of years and we'll continue to build on those learnings and the playbook that we had and adapt as necessary. It's a little difficult to predict exactly what it's going to look like but we feel -- said a different way we feel better prepared and more resilient for the COVID journey of 2022 in China than we did in 2020.Sure. I mean firstly on -- firstly let me step back both. The away-from-home channels whilst we have recovered to our 2019 levels the away-from-home channels have not yet fully recovered. And in part the -- and we -- I think I've talked about this on previous call we've lost outlets in the course of the pandemic. That's true of the away-from-home and that's also true of the fragmented grocery trades. And so there has been an impact on the number of outlets. It's not fully back. Of course there is a distinction by sub-channel with away-from-home particularly QSR has done well particularly those with digital and drive-through have done well. So the away-from-home channel even in a country can't be considered as a thing. You need to break it down into the different subcategories and really look at it by that. But again globally it's not quite back at the 2019. There are big distinctions depending on what sort of sub-channel we're looking at. In terms of the current global status yes China very much impacted by COVID lockdowns but there are other parts of Asia Pacific Southeast Asia where there were pressures on the away-from-home channel. I mean let me include Japan which only just lifted the state of emergency and we should start to see that improve. So as you think about the rest of the year there are places where there is recovery yet to come. And of course if there are recessionary impacts either because of recession or loss of purchasing power in the face of inflation in certain parts of the world then that will be an offsetting factor as we go into it.I mean we have a whole series of different situations around the world. I think the starting point is there's not one universal answer to this question. And part of that is because the nature of the retail landscape the nature of the distribution systems and the nature of the alcohol regulation is different in different parts of the world. We certainly start from the principle that our primary interest is in the brands of The Coca-Cola Company. To the extent -- and you've heard me talk about like never say never in a kind of a probalistic view of things to the extent that a case can be made for other products being on the trucks probably other beverage products including alcohol and that is somehow going to make the system the bottlers and it's going to sell more of our brands then that is a question we're going to look at. And there are certainly parts of the world. We're going down that road has been successful in selling more Coke products. Chile would be an example of that where there are other beverage brands are typically alcoholic ones whether that be beer or spirits on the truck and in the selling system which has allowed us to have more salespeople with a digital overlay as we talked about on the previous question so retailers can order things. But ultimately it's successful not because we can get more things on the truck it's successful because we can sell more of the Coke brands. And that was demonstrably true in Chile. Other parts of the world and not necessarily the same initial starting point and it might make more sense. But the question will always come back to -- I'm always open to hear any ideas that are going to drive more business results and better business results. And my starting point for more and better business results is selling more Cokes and Coke products.That's a simple one. No. I'm not sure there's anywhere in the world that Coke Zero is bigger than Coke. There are certainly some countries in the world where the combination of Diet Coke and Coke Zero sell approximately the same as Coke Classic. In the end Coke is a great franchise. We make available the classic version the Coke Zero Sugar version and we invite consumers to drink the one that best suits them. We are not trying to predetermine the mix structure. We are trying to offer the alternatives to get to invite the consumers into the franchise. But no specifically I don't expect Coke Zero to overtake Coke Classic in North America in the short term.Thank you operator. Well just to summarize obviously we're very pleased with our first quarter results. And while there are clearly more clouds on the horizon our strategy is intact and we are well equipped to execute and invest for sustained growth. Thank you for your interest your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.,0.002722161,0.00303942,0.000193306
19,19,COST,Galanti:,Look many of our KS items are of such large volumes. It's not unlike dealing with the comparable large volumes we do in a branded CPG item. And so we're out there fighting with both of them to try to mitigate those cost increases. KS still grows at a little faster rate than others but nothing discernible. I think we keep finding new items to do KS with and for a variety of different reasons. And so it continues to drive that brand. But no I don't think there's a -- we don't see a big difference of how that's changing.It's in the 50% range. Maybe it's slightly higher than that based on our when we originally bought what's now Costco Logistics a year and a half ago. We moved over a bunch of volume we've grown it as well grown our total base of need. And I think we're slightly above the 50% that we felt we had capacity for at the time. And we certainly have plenty of capacity over the next few years. Mind you we're spending money on it. Part of our fulfillment and logistics as I think I mentioned on the last quarterly call within CapEx we had spended $340 million or so on a multi acre million 1.6 million square foot distribution facility in Southern California. That's for a variety of needs. Some of the -- much of what we bought Innovel acquisition in March or April of 2020 more than 10 million square feet of space around the country much of its leased. Much of its fine by the way but we're not all that was geographically particularly the big sites 2 billion square foot sites were an area is where we're stronger relative to where Sears is stronger or they had most of their business at the time. So we're still spending money on it and upgrading it. But weâ€™re -- again from a merchandising standpoint we're very excited about it. And it's helped us grow that business in a big way. And given our small market share of many of those items particularly on the plant side we feel there's a lot of growth potential for us.Honestly I can't. I don't have that detail in front of me. Generally speaking you've got electronics that like TVs and what have you that are going down in price maybe a little less this year because there's less promotions because of shortages. I mean in every budget meeting every 4 weeks were presented examples of items where we're taking down the price of high volume key items by changing the packaging by moving some aspect of manufacturing to another part of the world. And so I don't have the detail here in front of me for that. Sorry.I will -- somebody is just running out of the room to see if they can grab that sheet. And I'll answer it as soon as they get back if you want to ask another question or move on to the next one. But I'll [indiscernible] gets back.Oh well as soon as we know you'll know or the day after. The -- look our cash position is strong. One of the things I pointed out is our CapEx is also increasing in a conscious way notwithstanding that our cash flow from operations is growing at a quite a stronger rate as well. It's something that we've done 4x in 8 years. We and the shareholders seem to like it when we do it and so I'm not trying to be cute but we haven't made that decision at this juncture. It's probably a win not if but when it'll be -- when we do it.I don't have the exact number but I'm willing to bet it's 80% plus. I could be wrong a little bit but it contracted. Now recognizing with contracts we might do 1 2 and 3 year contracts. So we're still benefiting on 3-year stuff. And then if any little on 2-year stuff and now gone beyond the benefit of the 1-year stuff And so it's over two or three year period but our assumption is is it'll take less than that time to start to normalize somewhat.Is it happen today [indiscernible] yes.But it's -- I think we again we probably with other large users of freight and containers have probably done a pretty good job of at least staggering that not having to do a lot of spot stuff so far.Okay. What they came back with right now is we don't have -- I don't have quickly average ticket changes. But the total spend per executive member compared to a Gold star member is almost 3x.Call it 2.5. Thank you.So you still might have more pennies per gallon but the margin itself was down.[Indiscernible] e-commerce. Yes and again I would read a lot into any of that description. We're just trying to share with everyone directionally what helps it and hurts a little bit. e-commerce just given all the activity we've gotten expenditures on fulfillment and expansion and doing what we can over time when we're pulling tickets if we -- if something else happened. I don't view as a big issue from it. It's not whatever -- whether the margins up a little down a little it's less about competition and more about what's the product mix that month or week. And what else is going on with this rapid expansion and investment in it?It's over a third. So weâ€™re third great.Thank you.I don't have that detail with me. But generally speaking tires have picked up as an example of an ancillary business. But the Costco auto program is down because there's a shortage of cars out there. Travel is up not where it was pre it was almost back to where it was pre-COVID. And then delta variant hit. And then it was coming back again and then Omicron hit. So it fluctuates pretty quickly. Omicron though and I'm trying to think the other things. Food courts have come back. Not I don't think they're quite where they were but they're almost there. Hearing aids have come back. But still I think slightly below pre-pandemic. Articles doing great. Pharmacy is doing great helped frankly by the shots. We like other retail pharmacies providing plenty of vaccines.Okay.Well both in-store and online have picked up. The pickup from things like Instacart for same day fresh skyrocketed during the lock downs in mid to summer mid to late summer 2020 came down from those peaks but it's still way above where it was pre-COVID. E-commerce is as you know because we talk about every quarter is 8% or 9% of our sales on that company. There's $192 billion in sales for the year ended this last August. So that's a lot bigger than it was. 2 years ago well I think in the last 3 or 4 quarters the 2 year taxes 100% plus. But notwithstanding that and part of that is the big and bulky that has helped that number which we really weren't driving that kind of business in-store anyway. The fact that I think that as we've heard occasionally that notwithstanding some people don't like our mask requirements when we first put them in back in May of 2020 I think overall people felt if I've got to go out I'm going to go out to one place and [indiscernible] stuff. And with taller ceilings and wider aisles and all those things I got to believe that psychologically that's helped a little bit. At the end of the day we were all surprised by [indiscernible] March of 2020 we're surprised by the strength in non-foods categories summer and fall of 2020 much less now -- much the same now. It was because people weren't travelling and they weren't going to games and concerts but they were buying things for their home. And we certainly had on top of all the food items all the other things they could buy for their home. So that was a pleasant surprise to us and that's continued. In terms of other tests not a whole lot. I mean we did have that small test in New Mexico with buy online and pick up in store. [Indiscernible] as I mentioned on the call we have over -- a year from now have over 200 of our U.S warehouses with lockers. In terms of buying online pick up in store we're not quite sure about that. We have very busy locations there's not a lot of room for it. And it doesn't seem to be a lot of people clamoring [indiscernible] or half the people that come in and do that on a few things that we buy online and the lockers they come in and shop while they're there. And so that's what we want. So beyond that I don't think -- I think some of the things we're doing that I mentioned briefly about mobile and digital some of these things everybody else have we are sometimes late to the game on some of these things. But those are -- should be on that additive to what we do.I don't know exactly. I know that consciously they -- the buyers when they presented the budget meetings or talking about those issues we are bringing in things early. We certainly have -- you think about it what we call our depot our view of distribution system in the U.S was something like 10 million square feet. And we essentially slightly more than double that with the Innovel acquisition aside from other things that helps us with a little storage if we needed or bringing in things early. Recognizing we start with we are somewhat seasonal but historically volleys brought things in early anyway. So we've -- whatever it may be we certainly have the cash as somebody mentioned earlier to have some extra billion dollars invested in inventory even if it hangs around for a little bit. But I think overall some of our items are still a little later than they would be pre-COVID. But better than they would be if we were not doing as good a job as I think we are doing on forward buying.When I said it was 19 more in the last three quarters of the year fiscal year plus the [indiscernible].Sure. I think previous as relates to this year we had talked about I think 3.8 to 4.2 quote unquote now we're saying about four. These numbers are up from the mid threes over the last couple of year low to mid threes over the last couple of years. In fact last year's 3.6 included a $340 million or $345 million asset purchase that I mentioned earlier in the Southwest in Southern California which is basically a 1.5 million plus square foot facility with lots of acreage to help with our fulfillment as well as our import stuff. And so I think there's if you said what are the big things take you from the low threes to the low fours over a few years a period it's more international expansions which tends to be a little more expensive for location more expansion we -- in fiscal '20 we were down to 13 net new units because some delays with COVID. I think we were 20 and 21 and we're going to be 27 net new units this fiscal year. plus five relos which is -- six relos planned. We might miss that a little bit. But at the end of the day so there's more warehouses. Clearly more in the whole fulfillment concept starting with the $1 billion acquisition a year ago of what's now Costco Logistics starting with adding additional square footage to that as well as the international things. And even on the distribution side or what we call our cross stock depots spending money overseas now in some of these countries to do some of that in a better way. Actually building a mini depot in Hawaii where we have five locations? Seven I'm sorry. Seven locations but huge volume locations. And with a -- so weâ€™ve gotten to the volume and efficiency there that these are good investments. So it's a lot of those things. Mind you we still spend all in close to a $1 billion a year here in IT.That's -- by the way that's not all CapEx that's expenses go ahead I'm sorry.I don't know for the long-term I think four sounds about right for the next year or two. And if things continue to grow well -- go well and grow well maybe goes up from there a little bit. But we're not looking to spend it if we don't think we have good things to spend it on just because our cash flow has been exceeding net income plus -- our cash flow has been exceeding regular dividend plus capital expenditures and the like.I think it's -- I don't have the exact number but my guess is it's a small low to mid single-digit percentage. What it means though is when back -- going back all the way back to spring of 2020 and there were -- people were hoarding goods. We were going out to additional suppliers to see what we can get recognizing from their perspective it creates a new relationships which will honor. You only forward not just for the three months that we [indiscernible]. And so I think there were opportunities to just expand product brands by necessity into some things and with I think the -- going into last summer and fall with that advent of all the things for the home both patio furniture and [indiscernible] and barbecue grills and indoor furniture and electronics and gadgets for the kitchen we took advantage of that and brought in additional items. And so it's more of that than anything. And the treasure hunt yes. So it's still a small piece but I think it's -- when I sometimes -- when I go into some retailers I'm not going to go into any names but you'll see a shelf half empty or some spaces. First of all once you put something in there and but at the end of the day I think our buyers have done a very good job of keeping the warehouses full.You're breaking up entirely during that call. So I heard about every other word if you want to repeat yourself.From a competitive standpoint I mean there's lots of -- everybody is competitive. Again I think structurally our model allows us to [indiscernible] that. We talked about more pennies per gallon of profit that allows us to do some other things. I think we've got a -- I think we have a lot of levers to pull here. And we feel pretty good that we are able to hold the prices on key items. And to -- I don't really think that we consider the challenge of achieving a margin. We're pretty good at figuring out how to get there while still being the company we are in terms of competitiveness. So no big changes of what we see out there.Just there's a lot of changes every month and some things go up and some things go down. But overall we feel pretty good about it.I think there's still low hanging fruit on the tree here. We've talked about it a little bit we've done a little bit more targeting than we have ever done but very little there is more to come. It was just a year and a half ago that we hired someone at a relatively senior level in terms of data analytics. But that's not the only thing they're working on. And they're -- that group that he's put together. But so I think those are things that will come over time in the next few years. That's pretty much what I can tell you about that.Okay. I'm going to take two more questions [indiscernible].It's about 50 in the U.S and Canada which would imply and that's where we have the co-brand cards. And U.S and Canada is about 80% of our company. So the 50 be-comes a 40 if you rough numbers.Oh Iâ€™m sorry you can do it on any card not just co-brand. But in the U.S and Canada it's about 50.I mean from an argument that things are more costly. On the one hand maybe it reduces demand overall on the sense that we're the extreme value proposition that helps us. So who the heck knows. I think I was reading this morning and the paper was -- this is the highest inflation in so many years. Wasn't that long ago though 10 plus years ago that regular inflation was 2% or 3% a year. And of course it's going to be a little more right for a year. But at the end of the day I think it helps us a little because of the value proposition that we have.We pretty much have it now in most locations. And I'm speaking of the U.S. and Canada. And I know even across the street in many locations we've expanded it from originally two lanes of three or six to three lanes of three or even four lanes of three. So in a four lane area you could have 12 people checking out. And so my guess is still going to grow a little as we expand existing units to offer a little bit more of it. And it's been a positive.Well thank you everyone and have a good holiday season and we're around to answer additional questions. Have a good day.,0.01089564,0.056563735,0.017346661
20,20,PFE,Farrow:,In reference to the patient numbers weâ€™re really not in a position to speak to it because it does go hand-in-hand with revenue guidance. That said I think what weâ€™ve previously said still holds true that we expect growth in the back half of this year. A couple of things that are going to be driving that is our hope that the pandemic will subside and weâ€™ll start seeing more in-office visits which will drive more NRxs. And then just a reminder that we still have to go through the payer process on the pediatric side. And so we expect to have broader coverage by the middle of this year which of course will help revenues in the long run as well.Which we saw in this quarter as well yes.That's correct. That is correct. Yes particularly in the adults.Correct yes.And I think one of the other things that's important to point out is that we looked and showed you all a fair amount of [indiscernible] data. And we showed that many of the parameters on these patients were beginning to approach normality. We would love to have them actually arrive at mimicking the blood from a sickle trait individual rather than someone from a sickle cell patient. So that's the rationale for going higher to see if we can recapitulate that state that looks like sickle cell trait and no longer sickle cell disease.Correct.Sure Yatin. Itâ€™s a great question and it is something that we wanted to make sure was understood. The biggest issue in â€“ there's a delta between the NRx growth and the revenue guidance that we're providing. The biggest issues are really three folders. One we still don't have broad payer coverage on the pediatric side so while we might be shipping bottles or having requests come in we can't recognize revenues on that. So that's going to inhibit the revenue growth. The other aspect to a less extent is our increase in gross-to-net. And then finally we have a dynamic in Q2 similar to what we had in Q1 where the quarter ends on a Thursday. And we have seen is one of our customers especially distributor tends to buy on that date but that shipment is not received until the following quarter. So there results a fairly large purchase that does not get recognized in the second quarter. So that's part of the rationale as well for the lower on the guidance.Yes. You're talking about the follow up patient that we're restarting on therapy from Phase 1.We kind of said the toward the end of the year it's typically as where we try to present major news depending upon when the patients we start we would present all the data that we have. So it could be multiple months of treatment by that time.It's little early to have any adherence data. We only have a couple of months and in some cases some patients are still awaiting to receive their first bottles and that sort of thing. So we don't have enough data yet although we can look at our 12 and older population and we know for example that the 12 to 18 year olds in that group are actually the highest adherence. And so we think the younger the patients and especially when the caregivers the parents are involved we have the potential with the four to 11 year olds to have some of the best adherence yet. So we're excited to look at that and we should be able to talk about that more later in the year.Hey Raju it's Jeff. So we had gross-to-net this quarter was about 16.3 and we do expect that to go up incrementally quarter-over-quarter to sort of a steady state of about 25% probably by midyear. I think it's better to look at it in aggregate because that's how we think about it. Particularly since price signal is flat between the two indications but you are right there are more patients in the four to 11 age group that are on Medicaid as opposed to potentially being dual eligible on Medicaid and Medicare. So it is slightly higher gross-to-net on those patients but in the aggregate we do expect to get to that 25% by middle of next year.Yes. So just to be clear the plan was to do a proper Phase 2 study with dose ranging and we're doing that. What happened with the six patients is that they called back and said they'd like to go back on drug and we're opportunistic. So we thought that was fantastic news and an opportunity to oblige those patients and get more information but that's not a subsidy for our Phase 2 study. So we're starting our Phase 2 study. That's where we're going to get the proper dose range. We're going to get more data from these six patients. But again to be clear it's not our Phase 2 study.,0.002798657,0.00334096,0.000384079
21,21,WMT,Furner:,Yeah. Thanks for the question. This is John again. First as we said we're really pleased with the performance in food. And the team has just done a great job getting the entire supply chain back in stock including stores. You've got changes in the stores where we're shifting more of our stocking to overnight so we can free up more capacity during the day for things like picking as Doug said and do that in a way that's conducive to customer shopping so excited to make those changes. As far as price gaps we've always had a principle here that everyday low price is important. In the quarter we had about 30% more rollbacks in stores than what we would have had a year ago. Some other things that are important are the mix not only the mix in the entire box but the mix within food pleased with the share gains that happened in meat and produce and bakery. So even within the food categories the mix has been favorable to categories that tend to have better margins which is enabling us to maintain price positions that we -- that we've been running. And our gap expanded last year versus the market. We're pleased with the gap. We're proud of the gap. And we'll continue to use all the levers we can to maintain those kinds of price gaps. The merchants at Walmart this year are even more prepared than years in the past to be able to manage that because of the channels they mix. Our merchants across the business can manage the channels from stores to eCommerce first-party eCommerce third-party. And then finally with the additional revenue and profit streams we mentioned with Walmart Connect marketplace and fulfillment services that will just help us going forward with mix to make sure that we have the right gap for customers. I do agree with you that value is -- it could be more important than convenience last year but value has been an important pillar of ours for a very long time.Hey. Good morning and thanks for the question. Certainly 2020 was a challenge when it comes to inventory flow with all the phases we went through from the stock-up phase to people moving into their home and then demand and supply chain challenges all across that were related to pandemic. Early in the quarter I felt like we were making pretty good progress and then we had this ice storm where we had just a record number of locations closed for a few days which put some stress on the supply chain. And then as we got later into the quarter certainly we see improvements in our food and consumable business compared to what they would have been a year ago. In general general merchandise has been a bit mixed. It's better in many cases but there are some pockets where we continue to chase demand things like adult bicycles some of our categories in consumer electronics. We're monitoring things like delays at the ports and other factors in the supply chain. And we'll watch all those things closely to continue to react. But definitely some pockets in general merchandise that we're still chasing even as we speak today.Sure. Sure Peter. Thanks for the question. In general we have been working on capacity improvements and capacity growth when it comes to online pickup and delivery from stores. And that's something that we have been tackling for some time now. It accelerated last year and we managed things what we call things like slot utilization or available slots and we have more slots available for picking for scheduled orders than we've ever had. We also have more capacity to ship from store which leads to I think the second part of your question which is the in-home or the delivery at home. And I'd say a couple of things there. And number one we are expanding our -- what we call our Walmart in-home services which we just picked up another market and that's where we deliver food and other items from stores all the way into the home including in the refrigerator. We have our market fulfillment centers that you asked about. We have several that are in construction. We expect to be launching those either late Q2 or early Q3. So we'll be able to talk about that more once those launch. And then finally we are excited about our last mile business. We've been operating our first delivery vans that are Walmart-branded in a market here in Arkansas and we're learning a lot as we go forward. But we see lots of opportunities to serve customers whether it's in store it's at their home or it's at the curb and they want to do pickup. We want to be extremely flexible and be able to serve customers any way they want. Last year there was such a shift of people that were wanting to have deliveries shifted at home from shopping in store. I think what we'll see more this year is a balance between the at-home deliveries shopping in-store and pickup as people get back out. But as Brett alluded to earlier that's assuming that conditions of the pandemic continue to improve. And we'll be ready should there be change in either direction.Yes. I completely agree. And the big thing that we're doing is creating capacity to be able to serve more and we have begun work on market fulfillment centers where we can use locations as hubs for other stores and spokes. We've got a lot of really encouraging supply chain work going on that would help us use the right algorithms to be able to pull inventory from all across the network and be able to serve people. So encouraging just in the last few months to see that not only the capacity has gone up but eCommerce results have been strong delivery from stores has been strong delivery from fulfillment centers has been strong. So these capabilities we're putting in place will be a great foundation for this program as we move forward.Yes those relationships I believe will continue to grow because of things like the improvements in technology. We're working on improving the app and its core experience. Acquisitions like Zeekit and MeMD are also other ways that customers will be able to connect with Walmart effectively and we'll be able to help them with more and more in their life and take friction out make things simple for them.Sure. Let me take that one. This is John again. We're really excited about the performance in general merchandise in the quarter. As you mentioned we did make a number of changes with talent over the last year. Or the biggest change was last July when we pulled all of the channels together. And traditionally we had teams of people we called category specialists that were online and then we had buyers that were in-store. And we're referring to them all as merchants because the merchants now have the customer relationship across all channels. And the team has spent a lot of time thinking through and working on the right programs to determine what in our assortment goes in store what's 1P and then what's 3P. And I'll give you an example. Just last week I was in Minneapolis visiting one of our suppliers Nordic Ware who makes cookware here in the United States. And we went through the number of items that they have in stores what's doing well what's going to improve? And then their entire catalog is available in the marketplace. And so our merchants were able to manage the assortment across channels and that gives them more levers to be able to serve the customer in a way that's frictionless and very clear. But in the quarter we definitely saw some changes with the way customers shop partly due to stimulus but also just behavior changes. Brett talked about it earlier categories like personal care improving travel is starting to really kick back in. And when you look at all the categories that are selling at Walmart you can tell a lot about what's going with customers across the country. So we definitely saw behaviors that are starting to reflect more opening up and getting back out and going to see people. Our health and wellness business has been extremely helpful in administering millions of vaccines in the quarter. And then with some of the changes even in the last week we expect that some of these changes with the customer could continue but we'll continue to watch that as the year moves on.For the traffic in store the count of traffic as we said definitely changed in April probably late March a bit. That's when we started to cycle some of the really big stock-up trips and what was happening last year where fewer trips and big consolidation it did put a lot of strain and stress on inventory and things like paper goods and food and consumables. So this year would not -- as that shift began to occur and we saw the sheer numbers begin to reflect gains in the food categories. I think it was a combination of people getting back out in comparison to last year but also some normalization in terms of frequency of food that's purchased specifically within channels strong growth between all three. As we said in the US the total comp was 6% including eCommerce growth of 37%. And then eCommerce growth is a mix of what's being shipped to people's homes from fulfillment centers or stores and inclusive of pickup. Finally I'd just say that we continue to expand capacity in all channels. We're excited about the expansion of slots available for shopping in stores. We're excited about the amount of capacity we have in stores to ship to people's home. And then we're continuing to work and invest in the supply chain to have more capacity going forward for pure first-party eCommerce.Yes. Let me just add a bit on to the margin question. Certainly there was strength in general merchandise in the quarter. We talked about the strength in food. And food was more balanced this year than what we would have seen last year. Last year we were really heavy in dry grocery and stock-up items as the pandemic began. So the strength and share gains that we saw in the first quarter in food most specifically meat produce bakery and grocery but leading in the fresh areas is certainly helpful. The third point I think I'd make is inventory positioning at the end of the quarter. Our inventory level is up which is a good thing. Last year we had big stock-outs in grocery and in general merchandise so I feel much better about our inventory position. Brett -- as Brett mentioned our inventory is clean and we've been really disciplined about ensuring that we're clearing up end-of-season and seasonal. So we feel great there. And then the last thing I would say is the drivers of eCommerce contributed to profit rates have been strong. Having merchants in the position of having all channels in their remit given the category and what the customer wants is helping with the drivers of eCommerce which would include things like contributed profit rates Walmart Connect et cetera.This is John. Let me take your first question first. The share performance in general merchandise we think is about flat to last year and we manage it a month in arrear so our data is for February and March. So we feel good about the performance on through the first two-thirds of the quarter. Certainly saw as you said strength across general merchandise in the 20% range. So I think we're positioned well. Feel good about where the share is versus a year ago. Particularly excited about performances in categories like home and apparel in the quarter and the positioning we have going into the second quarter. Certainly some tightness in the supply chain as we mentioned earlier in select categories where we've had high demand and stresses in the supply chain. But we're watching that carefully and feel good about the improvements in in-stock all across the business including the fulfillment centers and stores. But again I think we're most encouraged by the demand and seeing things like travel and other things open up and being able to be ready for customers is important as we move forward. And then the second part of your question on fulfillment services we've got a number of capacity improvements that are coming online this year. So we're excited about the impact those will have not only on the top line and for the customer but also for our sellers. Our sellers are looking for more services and ability to ship and it's a great way to enable small businesses for growth. So as the year goes on we'll see more and more capacity come online for our fulfillment service business.Good morning Scot this is John. Specifically on your question on eComm we feel good about the drivers of the eComm profitability which is contributed profit rates and that would be gross margins less the cost of shipping. We also feel good about the alternative revenue streams that are included in eCommerce which are things like the marketplace fulfillment services. Like I said earlier we're expanding capacity we know we have seller demand and we're really proud of the triple-digit growth in Walmart Connect. So all of those added together are helpful in the eCommerce P&L. On the breakout we actually are not breaking out the difference in stores and eComm because it has just become so blurred as we transition to an omni business. We have our merchants that are overseeing all channels by category. Stores are acting as stores they act as pickup centers and in some cases fulfillment centers. We have fulfillment centers acting as fulfillment centers which go direct to home. And at times they ship to a store so they got -- the inventory can be consolidated with an order and then put into our last mile network. So it's just not possible for us to break those out given how blurred the lines have come. But overall I'd say the team are doing -- they're just doing a great job with the contributed profit rates and the mix within -- not only the mix within the business like general merchandise versus other things but within categories they're doing a great job improving contributed profit rates.Yeah and I would just add -- go ahead.Robby this is John. I just want to reiterate excitement for the idea of an omni-channel health care solution for customers and Walmart together. Our pharmacists and our pharmacies have performed very well in the last year given all the challenges they've faced. They've opened up curbside delivery delivery to home. We've got central fill pharmacies now helping assist with cost and efficiency on the service suite that they offer. It's of course different by state but the way our teams jumped in and found ways to help get the country vaccinated has been nothing short of amazing. I was in a store here locally last night and just seeing a number of people be able to walk up and get their vaccine is very encouraging. And then as Doug said the market changed last year. We had opened a number of clinics and we continue to open clinics. We're excited about the prospect that clinics bring. And then a large part of health care shifted to digital last year and the entire industry embraced that. So this acquisition of MeMD to enable relationships with customers on their device in their home and be able to execute service care with our pharmacies and clinics on the backside of that is a really exciting prospect and it's a big part of our flywheel going forward.,0.007496655,0.021480501,0.006158498
22,22,ADBE,Narayen:,Yes. Sterling I mean I think color-wise itâ€™s really still early in the year but I feel great about the way weâ€™ve been navigating all of the external issues that have come. And it was a strong Q1. As we prepared for this call we felt it was important to share with you the impact that we know of things whether itâ€™s the revenue or ARR for Russia whatâ€™s happening on EPS as it relates to the tax rate as well as to provide some more of the growth drivers. But I net it out by saying while we are not updating the annual targets as you pointed out weâ€™re really optimistic on the significant number of growth drivers that we have. And we will share more throughout the year because we still are all navigating what is a considerably unpredictable situation. Our strong Q1 however and the things that we control we feel excellent about.Yes. Jay when I think about the transformative things that weâ€™ve done in the company certainly the move to subscriptions the entrance into digital marketing what weâ€™ve done with data-driven operating model to drive the sort of financial cadence of the business they absolutely bubble to the top. But I would say those actually dwarf in comparison to the excitement that I feel about what product-led growth can continue to do. When you have hundreds of millions or billions of people using your software a good example of what weâ€™ve done is the constant innovation that weâ€™re delivering on the Document Cloud side. And I think David referred to some of the statistics whether itâ€™s sort of doubling what we see with web traffic and really being aware of the intent-based approach that people want when they come on the web to accomplish document actions what we are doing in mobile and doubling it. And I think product-led growth just relates to ensuring that all of our product teams have information at their fingertips as to how people are really using it so that we can rapidly iterate in terms of what customers want and delight them. And I think on the Creative Cloud to add to what David said to Saket as well what that means with Creative Cloud Express is as you have these millions of users weâ€™re constantly understanding where the search traffic is how do you improve it. And itâ€™s just a new way of liberating all of the product-led â€“ product teams to focus on whatâ€™s truly important and truly needle-moving as far as customer interest and customer sentiment. And itâ€™s something that David has pioneered. So Iâ€™ll have David add a little bit more. But I think the impact on how we serve customers the NPS and being able to continue to recruit and retain is significant.Maybe one last thing before Dan comments. I think both Dan and David talked about retention and engagement during the quarter. And to give you a little bit more Jay color in terms of that we look at churn rates. We look at reseller renewal. We look at 90-day cohort retentions. And in all of those I think as a result of the activity that weâ€™re doing on the product teams to help improve weâ€™re seeing improvement and getting to rates on all three of those that are better than they have ever been even prior to the pandemic. So I think thatâ€™s again another example of what gives us confidence in our offerings and our innovation going forward.Sure. So Keith maybe I will answer the last question first and then talk about it which is as we were entering the year and what we talked at the FA meeting if you actually â€“ I think we also got a couple of questions as it relates to what we were going to do on pricing and we alluded to the fact that we are constantly looking at it. And so while it was something that we were working on we actually just pretty recently finished the entire effort. So we didnâ€™t have it finalized but we always thought that it was timed with the new offerings to actually look at the pricing structure as well. And so the definite amount and the materiality of that we will know as we go through the process. But directionally we knew that we were going to be looking at pricing more exhaustively. I think in terms of the clarification of what we saw when the war broke out for the last couple of weeks that impact is not just felt in Russia and Belarus and Ukraine you see a little bit of that traffic across the region. So thatâ€™s really all I was alluding to. And we saw strength and that strength continued in the U.S. right through the quarter. And so not unsurprisingly we saw a little impact. So thatâ€™s all I was referring to as it related to the European situation. And did you have a third question Keith?So I think philosophically the way we are looking at it I will repeat what I said earlier which is we havenâ€™t done a comprehensive look at that in multiple years. And directionally I think the significant value that we have added has to do with people whether you are in businesses or whether you are a user of the entire apps. I mean we continue to add new apps to the â€“ whatâ€™s called the CC All Apps platform. And directionally we are just saying that is the area where we have to look at all of the increased value that we have. This is not driven in any way shape or form by any competitive response. So let me be categorical about that. This is raised by â€“ we continue to attract billions of people to the platform in terms of the interest. And with all of the new offerings that we have again as David said across web across mobile across the browsers we just want to make sure that as we continue to expand the offerings we are looking at the pricing in a good way. So the value that we have added to whether you are in teams with collaboration or whether you are to businesses continues to be a motivator for us to look at the prices as well on all the new apps that we have added. So hopefully that gives you color. Let me also back up and say this is for us all really about customers and delighting customers. But because we had an earnings call we said as this gets rolled out we at least want to give you some heads up because otherwise some of you would say why didnâ€™t you at least allude to it. As David said this doesnâ€™t have an impact in Q2 really. Itâ€™s a pretty small impact. So that was the rationale and thinking associated with it. And we will certainly roll this out with customers first and then we will share with you more of what the impact is. But thatâ€™s the way we look at how we move the business going forward.I will answer the first â€“ the third one first Keith as Dan does which is if you look at the growth the unit growth is being driven by single apps which is new subscribers and driving to it. So that trend in terms of continuing to drive single unit is definitely part of how we think about it. I will answer maybe one part of also how you have to think about it which is when you think about Russia and Belarus we have the ARR which is the book of business but there is no way to really get payments. And with all of the sanctions thatâ€™s there what we have factored is that book of business because we are not going to be getting payments from Russia that is the impact that Dan alluded to which is the $75 million for the rest of the year. So in addition to seizing new payment â€“ in addition to stopping new sales what you have to realize is for a service that exists as a SaaS-based service you are unable to collect payments. And so we have reflected that impact as well in the particular geographies.Thanks Kash. I mean to net it out I definitely feel more positive about business moving forward than I ever have because just if you take a step back and look at all of â€“ first look at Q1 we had a strong Q1. We clearly beat our targets in what is perhaps the most unpredictable situations that exist in the world. So we feel really good about Q1. We feel really good about the new initiatives that â€“ both in Document Cloud and Creative Cloud and in Experience Cloud that David and Anil spoke to. I did allude to the fact that when you think about the seasonal cadence and the rhythm of the business certainly some of thatâ€™s impacted. And perhaps the thing that you are alluding to Kash was in Q2 of last year there was sort of a catch-up as â€œsmall and medium businessesâ€ came on â€“ come back online. And so you have to just factor what that is in. But both in terms of the revenue growth in DME for Q3 and Q4 as it relates to getting more similar to Q1 as well as the ARR we are optimistic about the second half. The only reason we didnâ€™t talk about Q2 is because we actually gave specific guidance and targets for Q2. So donâ€™t take that as anything as opposed to we have given you targets for Q2 and we are trying to give you color on what happens in Q3 and Q4. So hopefully that helps Kash. And on the DX side since there have been fewer questions on the DX side I mean what we have done Summit was really exciting the amount of new announcements that we have done there. Every person that I talked to in the C-suite continues to want to really focus on digital transformation and customer experience management. I am excited. I am back on the road again. It feels great. We have employees back in the office and facilities. People want to meet and digital engagement is top of mind. So across all three of our businesses we didnâ€™t talk about the document business. $100 million in ARR for the quarter $2 billion book of business really good adoption of our new functionality whether itâ€™s on the web as well as a unifying sign with Acrobat which was a big movement that we are trying to do. So I think all of those are positive. I think the one impact that again maybe Dan can just touch on is certainly it doesnâ€™t impact our core business. But the EPS you just have to factor some of the revenue and other considerations that happened. But for the functional part of the business I feel really good.Kash at the FA meeting we talked about what the overall addressable market opportunity is. But I really feel like we can get billions of users to use our product. And then they will be the spectrum of people who will be paying us on a subscription business as well as others who will perhaps take advantage of some of the freemium offerings that we have. We are starting to see that kind of adoption with the Document Cloud certainly right where you have 0.5 billion people who have used our â€“ a Reader and other products. But I think in terms of Creative Cloud Express my hope and my aspiration is that every single person who has a story to tell uses some part of the Creative Cloud Express. We are off to a great start there Kash. I think on the differentiation as David said we have the platform. We have every single piece of technology that we need to deliver a great compelling experience. And now we are also world-class at making sure that we capture search-based intent. So we want to anticipate what people want to do with Creative but I would be disappointed if that doesnâ€™t just continue to be a huge growth area in terms of new users to our platform.And since that was the last question I wanted to again thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased with the performance. We think we had a really strong start to the fiscal year across all three of our businesses Creative Cloud Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. And more than that I think our ability to continue to delight customers and deliver on the innovative roadmap gives us a lot of confidence associated with the new initiatives taking stock and contributing to the future growth at Adobe. The spotlight I believe on digital will just continue. And as we get back to more normalcy I think that will only all go well for both Adobe and our customers. And the successful Summit that we just organized I think is another indicator of the interest that exists in our solutions. So thank you for joining us today and we look forward to sharing more as we go through the year. Thank you.,0.002723048,0.003122687,0.000229964
23,23,MCD,Kempczinski:,Sure. Well the -- we're actually in field right now getting detailed feedback from the 14 000 participants that we had. But I would say anecdotally what I heard back from people was just a tremendous excitement of being back together again. And when you haven't seen some of these people in four years which is true for many of our franchisees who typically use convention as a way to connect with their colleagues around the world just a lot of excitement to be back together. And also talk about what we've been through and also where we're headed to. And I think there was a nice balance of looking back but also making sure that we're being forward-facing on that. I did hear many people talk about this being one of the best conventions that they've attended or can remember attending. Now part of that maybe it's been four years since the last one. But there was I think a sense amongst franchisees when they consider all the things that have gone on in the world boy it feels really good to be part of McDonald's. And that goes to my comment about there's never been a better time to be part of McDonald's. All you have to do is look at sort of what everyone else has gone through and compare our relative position on that. And I think you come away that sentiment. We did share as finally a number of things that we are looking at particularly around restaurant operations. This includes everything from automated order taking which -- many of our international franchisees have not seen our US franchisees have had more visibility on that a lot of interest and attention in that as you would imagine. We also showed them some different ways that we're thinking about dual lane drive-thru and perhaps adding a second percent window at a dual lane drive-thru. That was also interesting for people and other ways for us to bring automation into kitchen operations. So that was kind of everything that was going on at convention but just a lot of connecting and socializing as well.Sure. So I'd start with the fact that we've always viewed loyalty for us as a frequency play. In the US we see roughly 80% of the population in a given year that visit our restaurant at least one time. So we don't have a big reach opportunity at McDonald's. Our opportunity is always about driving frequency. And one of the things that we've been encouraged by what we've seen with loyalty so far is it has proven to be an effective way for us to drive frequency among our users. In terms of where we are our view is we're still early innings on this. We have low levels of penetration versus our total market size opportunity here. And for us the focus then is continuing to drive overall enrollment but also to be driving engagement. And one of the things that we're spending time on as we get more facts under our belt here is what is the right metric that's most predictive of future performance? So is it absolute members? Is it monthly? Is it 90 days? We're doing a lot of analysis on that to just get tighter as we've had a year's worth of data under our belt. And we'll at some point I'm sure once we've got some conclusive findings on that come back and share that with all of you. But early innings would be the headline.Yeah. I think the headline is that the overall US consumer from our vantage point is in good shape. And consumer balance sheets in the US broadly speaking again at the average are strong which gives us the optimism as I talked about earlier as we head into Q2. Now you deaverage which is what you always have to do in these situations. And I think you do start to see that the lower income consumer particularly around gas prices and the pressure that that puts on pocket book the pressure around rents that there probably is an increased value sensitivity with that lower income consumer. We don't have the detailed type of data that you would love to have that would allow us to slice and dice it. So we're having to use ZIP codes and other things as proxies for that. But I think it's probably fair to say that the lower income consumer is probably feeling more pressure than the average consumer or certainly the wealthier consumer. And that's why for us we need to make sure that we continue to have value be an important part of our proposition. It always is one of the things that defines McDonald's is making sure that we stay strong on value. We're pleased right now because as we look at our value scores relative to our competition consumers are still giving us a lot of credit for being a good value. But we just need to make sure as we're working through some of the inflation that Kevin talked to earlier that we don't lose track of -- we still need to be providing good value to consumers. And -- there's a lot of different ways for us to do that. Joe and the team are spending a lot of time with US franchisees on how to think through that and navigate it. But we've always got to stay competitive on value. When we lose sight of that there's a long history of that being where we've kind of gotten off track. So I can promise you we're not losing sight of it. But broadly the US consumer from our vantage point is still in good shape.Sure. Well without getting too much into decomposing our comp into various dayparts I would tell you that whether you look at it on a Q1 basis or you look at it on a three-year basis we've actually seen from a comp sales standpoint we've seen breakfast and dinner be standout performers for us. Lunch has been a little bit more modest from a performance standpoint. So we feel really good about what we've seen again at breakfast and dinner. Late night traded off as you would have imagined for a variety of reasons. Some of it was related to operating hours there et cetera. But those two elements are strong. As we think about what lunch is going to look like going forward it's certainly the biggest part of our daypart mix. We're still seeing growth in that. It's just not at the same levels that we're seeing in those other two dayparts. Kevin I don't know if you want to add?The only thing I would add which may be is the question behind the question. I don't know but I'm just â€“ I'll throw this out there. I said in the last earnings call that our whole mentality is we're in a share-taking mode. And we saw that play out in Q1 and it's played out not just on the quarter but it's played out over the last several quarters. And it's played out from both a comp sales standpoint as well as from a guest count standpoint within QSR. So the relative mix within our own is interesting but it's also about how is our performance compared to our QSR peers and our mindset is about stealing share and that's what we're seeing in the numbers both on sales and on traffic.Yeah. So if you broaden it out to IEO which is a larger definition we are seeing a little bit of traffic share loss in the US. I mean it's a â€“ less than a decimal point type of share loss there. I think it's maybe 0.3 or something like that that we've lost versus IEO. That's in the US only. If you look at it globally we're actually taking share globally against even the IEO market. And as you know in IEO in the US there's just so much noise around who was open who was closed. It's difficult when you're comparing share change versus 2021 or you're comparing share change over a three-year time period given all the noise in the number It's a little bit challenging to actually make a conclusion off of that. But we're looking at performance both on IEO and QSR and feeling good about what we're seeing.Sure. So if you think about burger and chicken as being our two sandwich areas we've taken share in the US in both of those. Beef is obviously -- or burger is obviously the most significant or a sizable part of our business there. And if you think about where we're at there we own little over 1/3 of the market from a share standpoint in the US on beef and we've picked up about a share point there versus where we were in 2019. If you think about chicken which is not for us as sizable but still an important part of the business we've picked up about 0.5 point of share there if you look at where we were prior to the launch of the Crispy Chicken Sandwich. So seeing good share performance in both of those areas. And our thing is with our Accelerating the Arches strategy we're focused on chicken coffee and burgers. It's those three areas and we maniacally track share on all three of those categories across all of our markets.Yes. I'll give my own thought and then Kevin can chime in. But I think for the last -- since COVID hit basically at the beginning of 2020 we've -- in all of the various calls with you and I think probably across the entire industry we've all struggle to figure out what is the right way to think about traffic. And probably our historic approach which is guest counts we -- we've recognized that there are shortfalls with that which is why Kevin came up with his other category which was called stuff and just selling more stuff or said another way just more units. I would say on all of that it's still unclear to us what is the right way for us to be assessing. We're still seeing a lot of changing consumer behavior whether it's through digital whether it's through delivery and how all of that sort of levels out and then you get a clean read of what the go-forward means. I don't think we're there yet at this point. But we certainly look at our relative performance versus our competitors on that. And so long as we're beating our competitors we feel good about it. And we worry may be a little bit less about what the absolutes are and it's more about are we stealing share.Sure. Well I'd start with I think digital changes everything. So today I don't know 90% plus of the customers -- 90% of the customers coming into my restaurant I don't know who they are. I don't know there prior purchase. I don't know what their buying pattern is. I don't know are they a deal seeker. Are they someone who always orders the same thing? Do they like to try new things? So as I get better and better visibility into that customer I can actually track and identify their preferences over time it starts with I'm going to be able to give them a better experience. I'm going to be able to give them faster speed of service. I'm going to be able to give them a cleaner app a cleaner menu board. And I'm going to be able to give them deals offers programs that are more personalized to what they're looking for. It's not going to necessarily be a one-size-fits-all type of thing it's going to be much more bespoke to what each customer is looking for. And digital allows us to do a level of personalization at scale at McDonald's that is almost impossible for us to do through sort of more of our analog type of approach. As you start to then get much more of this data about buying behaviors purchases you can get it integrated into restaurant operations and it gives you opportunity to do automation. It gives you speed of service opportunity positioning that has labor benefits. So it can change I think just the entire unit economic profile for the better of what a restaurant looks like. We're still very early on this. So I don't want -- I want to caution against anybody out going out there and running and building a new model off of this. But if you go 10 years out that's where we're headed to because I think we all recognize those of us who are in the business day to day there is tremendous opportunity there if we can make further inroads.,0.003583024,0.00564754,0.001003632
24,24,CSCO,Robbins,: Well yes. And if you look at the compare from a year ago the compare was actually tougher so the momentum actually increased if you look at it that way. But our teams have -- we talked about 6 years ago that we were going to do the work to try to get back into these franchises in the cloud players and that's been a big -- that's a big big success for us right now and that's certainly helpful. And then we've got all these other trends happening right now. You got 5G build-out you've got Wi-Fi 6 you got every enterprise customer realizing that they're not going to get caught with the next crisis not having their technology modernized Our switching growth is at a rate that -- 2 years ago if I'd have told you we're going to be doing that or if you'd told me we were going to be doing that we'd have both been crazy. So it's -- so I think your point of at some point in the future you would expect order rate and revenue would they have to get in line? I think over a time period yes; not necessarily in one quarter versus the other because of the transition in the business model. Because if you look at the RPO that we're pulling off the Balance Sheet every quarter I go back and look at what that would've been 6 years ago. It wouldn't have been anywhere remotely close to what we are so we would've been in a much more dire situation relative to supply chain and revenue right now if we hadn't been making the transition that we've been making.: Yes.: Thanks Simon.: Well we can't give you the number because it's impossible to calculate. But if you look at last quarter's product growth at 31 this quarter's product growth at 33 the RPO they'll be pulled off the balance sheet [Indiscernible] meaningfully higher. There is -- it's the largest backlog we've had in the history of the Company. So it's hard to say. But Scott anything to add?: What I would say is that while short term this doesn't feel great I think what we're seeing is the customers have decisions they're making right now and they're choosing our technology across the board. They're choosing the innovation that our teams have built. And I think that's going to bode well and that's a great indicator for us in the future. And I think the fact of the matter is is with that RPO and the backlog that we have that stuff's going to ship. So there's going to be some short-term issues but it's going to catch up.: I'm not sure book-to-bill matters anymore. That mattered years ago when we were a hardware Company and everything was sort of net 30. We haven't looked at that in ages. I'm sure it's on a spreadsheet somewhere from years ago but I would say the backlog is -- Scott how would you want to characterize it? I'll leave that with you.: It is -- we have great visibility to what we need to build and ship out and that's why you see us taking the steps we're taking in terms of adding inventory making some of the longer-term purchase commitments that you see show up in our filings. It's really trying and doing everything we can to try to support our customers and get that product out the door as quickly as possible. But you can get a sense of the building backlog just by looking at the delta between what's been showing up in bookings and what we're able to push out the door in revenue.: Yes. We worry about it every day and so do our competitors. And so it's everybody is trying to fulfill what customers need and I guess the silver lining is this is not necessarily unique to us but it's certainly frustrating.: I would say there's a couple of things. Number 1 the performance of the Silicon One architecture is pretty incredible. And in a world where sustainability is a massive issue for everyone when you look at the performance to power consumption ratio it leads the world and so when you look at the speed and the number of ports and the performance that we're able to deliver at the lower power consumption it is super meaningful and so -- not only is it great technology but it comes at a significantly lower power consumption and I think those are couple of big reasons.: Okay Rod. Thank you. I think you're probably right on -- I don't know if it goes back 10 years. I have not looked at it but it was significant and I think it's a combination of what we talked about. For three years on this -- on these calls we talked about when's 5G going to be real. And so we see it real now. And so you sell site routers that are backhaul. Routers are a big deal. Packet core is a big deal. You get into the cloud providers and you have either standalone silicon standalone software or integrated systems and increasingly it's -- we're getting more integrated systems work which has been helpful. The Edge with the ASR 9K. The Cisco 8000 is being obviously super successful. The NCS product line optical Acacia is doing very well. And so all those technologies just line up. And I think that when you look at the -- I'd say I'd summarize it with 3 major trends just us getting into the 400-gig build-out in the cloud. As the 5G build-out in the service provider space and then a re-architecture that's happening in the service provider space to just basically flatten and simplify the whole routed optical network strategy that our teams have talked about. Those are the drivers. And you had a second question Rod.: Okay. You snuck in 3 there Matthew. But I'll start with the gross margin question. The guide that we gave for the quarter at 63.5 to 64.5 is exactly the same guide that we gave you in Q1 and it's the exact same combination of effects. There are some competing factors inside there right on the -- within the gross margin. We've got price increases that will come online as the year goes on more toward the second half and really more toward the end of Q3 and into Q4 we'll start to see that will be a tailwind to gross margin. We've got the cost increases and within that it's not just component cost increases which are a part of it. It's also logistics cost increases as we've talked about and those have gone up across the board as well. So that's what's in the gross margin. It's strictly tied to the various elements of costs within our supply constraints that we're dealing with. On the cap allocation which I think was your second question our cap allocation policy is unchanged. It's exactly as we stated at Investor Day which is first and foremost to support the growth of the business. Beyond that to obviously continue to protect the dividends through time offset dilution of our equity plans which is what you saw us do during the quarter we just closed and then longer term return excess cash in the most tax efficient way we can to our investors. So we continually evaluate that. I will tell you it's an evaluation that is not just done once a quarter; it's an evaluation that we do continually on that front. The M&A question is one that probably doesn't pay to get too deep into. M&A has been a part of our strategy as a Company. Over time we talked about a couple of acquisitions in the opening commentary. EPSAGON which closed during the quarter and Replex which we announced during the quarter is not yet closed. You should continue to see us doing some of those more of the build-by type acquisitions. I think it helps us accelerate innovation. Longer term it's a space that has been part of our strategy for some time.: Thanks Tal. First of all I think when you look at the RPO numbers that Scott talked about that would indicate that there's a significant portion of our revenue that we recognize each quarter that is not hardware. If you look at the RPO that we're going to recognize over the next 4 quarters and it will increase as we go through the year; it's sitting at close to $16 billion right now and so I think -- and you look at the product RPO growth in the quarter was up 18% so I think that's actually being successful. I just think the hardware part of the business had suffered the most a year ago. And so I think it's just coming back strong and we're -- but I actually think that we're actually making great progress on the software side so I'm not concerned about it. I obviously would like for it to go faster but I think it's -- if I look at what we're pulling off the balance sheet today and revenue versus what we were 6 years ago it's seriously meaningful.: You see 1/12 of it in a quarter --: -- a fraction of it in a given quarter.: And Tal we're also -- if you think about the franchise wins that we're having in the cloud webscale players those are like recurring revenue models because you're in until the next transition just like we were out before so that's another reason that -- if you look at software as a percentage of total revenue as we continue to make progress there I think software is going to grow and we hope to be growing both sides of it to be candid.: It's a really good question I think first of all they are -- I think they are executing ahead of what we expected from a numbers perspective. So that's first and foremost. And then secondly I think just the work the teams are doing to continue to deliver on the innovation there's work going on between the silicon and optics teams today. We're winning new franchises. I just think it's just been a great partnership since they've been onboard. Scott anything to add.: Yes Samik. My answer is pretty quick. We're not seeing any impact from it but we're clearly monitoring it. We live in -- we are in such a dynamic world right now. And you see what's happening in some places in Europe but we actually saw acceleration in the last 90 days.: constraints began to clear up earlier in the second half we'll be toward the high end; if it's later in the second half we'll be toward the low end. The real difficult question to answer is where in the second half do we really see that starting to clear up. What we have seen is stabilization. It did deteriorate earlier in the first quarter. As the quarter went on I mentioned earlier we saw signs of stabilization and we also have great visibility coming from what's in RPO. It's going to creep into our revenue stream in the second half and knowing very clearly what's in the backlog so we know exactly which components to go chase to build that out. So confident in the full year. The question of when this all clears up in the second half is really what's going to dictate whether we're more towards the high end or more towards the low end.: Alright. Let me let me just wrap up by thanking all of you for spending time with us today and just saying I'm really proud of what the teams have accomplished. It's incredibly complex environment. When you look at -- we delivered 8% revenue growth 8% non-GAAP EPS all three geographies product bookings over 30%. ARR growing to $21.6 billion double-digits RPO at $30.1 billion double-digits. I really am just pleased with what the teams have done. It was truly a great quarter in a very complicated time. Large backlog in our history it will ship and combine that with our RPO when we feel good about where we're headed we will continue to plan and work hard on navigating these component issues and our supply chain team continues to work night and day to do that. We feel good still about our annual guidance and I have a lot of confidence about where we are with our innovation and with the Company in general. So thanks for spending time with us and we'll talk to you next time.,0.005296657,0.015624583,0.004685581
25,25,TMO,Casper:,Thanks.Good morning.Yes so Derik thanks for the question. So as you know we never really talk about specific customers unless a customer is announcing this on their own behalf and then we're more than happy to make some high-level comments right because it's really our job is to support our customersâ€™ activity. I think that our take is that we did a really good job of supporting our clients during the course of the pandemic across all of the different activities. And that enhanced our reputation our trusted partner status with our customers. And as in the case of Moderna they had the opportunity to work with us and decided to leverage our capabilities in Greenville North Carolina and our expertise to support their future pipeline from a sterile fill finish perspective. And it's super exciting in terms of the capabilities of the things that we will support longer term from them there. We have many different models of how we work with our clients in our pharma services business. And it's our job to support them in the best way that they want. We do have what we call condo models where customers have some dedicated capacity. We have the traditional fee-for-service models. And then we have some other innovative ones. The other public one obviously was announced a couple years ago which was CSL right which is we took over one of their facilities we're going to be manufacturing one of their new therapies and they are expanding the collaboration with us. So it's a long menu of options and our job is to help our customers navigate their future and be really valuable to them.Yes it's a great question right. So when we think about living and navigating through an inflationary environment our team is doing a good job of managing productivity and managing cost and mitigating what can be mitigated. So I'm very pleased with that. Our expectation for pricing is â€“ and in normally as you know it's a half point to a point of price that we get within our business. And this year we would expect that price would be about double the high end of that range or about two points of price within our outlook for the year. So it's our job to support our customers to explain the inflations and where we can offset it and where we need customers to support us. And those dialogues have been constructive and positive.Yes. So when I look at the performance I look at the pipeline I look at the authorizations which is the new wins. When I look at the revenue when I cut it by the different types of customers we had a really strong start to the year. When I look at I read not all but some of the different commentary and the differing views out there my take is is that there was nothing abnormal in cancellations in the quarter there was no trend to any of that. And actually we are on track to deliver very strong results but the 11% growth that we're looking at for this year is really impressive because last year we're spectacular right? In terms of the growth that the business delivered. So against a challenging comp that's really really encouraging and authorization support that for this year but also support the long-term expectations that this is a high single digit growth business. And when we drive synergies it can be better than that. So super cool times but obviously early.You're welcome.Yes. I mean I can't wait until May 18. It'll be super cool. We're going to have it back in person. It'll be a great way to showcase our team and showcase the great things going on at the company. And we'll explain some of the stuff today in some more detail. And so it'll be very positive from that perspective. When I think about the business right we highlighted some of the macroeconomic dynamics right? Because if you watch TV you read the papers you're on the internet whatever it is that you get the external world it's a bumpy time in the world but when you get within our four walls right now it is awesome. I mean it is an amazing time of the company the momentum is huge. The customers are doing well we are gaining markets share and it is super cool. And so when I think about that environment of delivering 16% core growth against a very challenging comparison right? I think from recollection we had 53% organic growth last year and I think 13% base growth and we had bookings that were even stronger than our revenue. So it gives you a sense of how good things are and all the geographies all of the end markets were actually quite good. Right. So I feel good about the outlook. I feel good about the momentum we were able to de-risk the vaccines and therapies even though I think there are scenarios that is going to be above that sort of de-risk level. And so I think the world is super positive and when I think about the macro I worry about our colleagues. Like I worry about our colleagues in China. I worry about our 300 colleagues in Ukraine. That's the kind of stuff that when I read about macro that's really where my concern is. It's less about the business self associated with it.Thanks Vijay.Our guidance assumes it's all in Q2 in terms of construction for China.Yes. So in terms of healthcare and diagnostics the core there was actually quite good. When I think about we had broad-based strength in terms of core growth there in the high single digits. So I feel good about that. And there was obviously some level of COVID disruptions and things of that sort but in aggregate the results were strong across healthcare and diagnostics. And obviously we had less revenue in the testing which is why the customer base is down down roughly 15% but underlying that the core is â€“ was quite good and feels like that outlook will continue to be positive. Thanks for asking the questions.Yes. So Puneet what I would say is the end market pharma biotech incredibly strong with the mid-teens growth organically and if you â€“ because we do everything on an organic basis in our end market description as opposed to a core organic as it gets too confusing to think about all the history but if you included the PPD numbers in that end market it would be better than the mid-teens. So very strong orders which is a good indication now the future is really strong right? So the activity level is very good and the outlook is very strong. And when we have our â€“ we've completed all of our business reviews and we talk about what are they seeing within those different customer base? Actually the outlook is good. So one way to think about is at a company level you take a long-term perspective right? We say our 7% to 9% core organic growth. Pharma biotech will be above that but when you kind of work your way through the math around the assumptions it doesn't nearly need to be the rate that is growing at to drive 7% to 9% growth right? We had a 15% growth in pharma and biotech and we grew 16% in the quarter right? So when you have strong growth in that end market given that it's a little more than half our revenue it really flows through hugely. And given the last 10-plus years even longer than that of the growth we've been able to deliver in pharma and biotech I'm super bullish about what our outlook is. And I can even remember I was here with the patent clips like years and years and years and years ago and we actually grew well through those because we helped our customers navigate productivity challenges that they were facing. That was a large pharma dynamic and a long-time ago but we're so attuned to our customer needs we helped them through it. So that's how I think about it and I feel great about what the outlook is.No actually the performance was very strong. I looked at obviously the other companies that reported. I feel good about our performance in the bio-production defined that that way. And we had good strength in cell culture media purification resins pharma analytics and single-use technology. So actually no there's nothing there that sort of we gleaned in terms of that some difference. So actually its quite broad-based to strength.Yes. We're still looking at how others performed in China in the quarter. So I feel good about our double-digit growth and team's doing a nice job and the momentum is broad base. So our customers do value the scale and the depth of capabilities that we have. Like we really create a spectacular experience for our customers in China so it doesn't surprise me that the business is performing well and we'll help them navigate the very challenging time with the pandemic and then get back to business as usual as that wanes.Yes. So Matt thanks for the â€“ thanks for the final question. Yes. So as Stephen said the Analytical Instruments business had a really good start to the year. Good growth and revenue and really strong growth in bookings. I would say that the one end-market that's really; really humming is what I call broadly the material science applications semiconductor advanced materials battery technologies really very strong growth. That's not implying that the life science is very healthy and doing well and the businesses are doing really well. But I'd say the continued demand and outlook for the material science related business is really strong and that bodes really well for the growth of our instruments business this year and into next. So that would be the thing I'd probably highlight.Thanks for the question today. And let me do a quick wrap up. So thanks everyone for joining the call. We're very pleased with the strong start and we're in a very good position to achieve another excellent year. And I look forward to updating you at our upcoming Investor Day on May 18th and as always thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks everyone.,0.004963613,0.008838058,0.002303682
26,26,CRM,Benioff:,"Well I'm so excited that you're excited about Amy's new model. I mean I by the way am also - I mean she - I think Kash said it well. She has reimagined the business. She has rebalanced our ratios. She's figured out how to take this kind of changes that have occurred in the pandemic which is less travel and less real estate and less events and kind of rebuilt the company from the bottom up. And I think that's where we're really starting to see Amy's genius kind of take place which is that -- when I look at the revenue $5.96 billion up 23% 20% in constant currency. The cash flow $3.23 billion. But then when I really get down into this operating margin at 20.2% but also the ability to raise for the year it really gets down to this new model that she's really pioneered and has installed in the company. And it's given us a fresh look at how we run our business and what we're going to do in the future and how we think about the right balance between revenue and cash flow and margin. And the pandemic gave all of us the ability to reset our lives but also our businesses. And when we look at resetting our businesses we also have to reset our financial models. And I think that this is the result of now four amazing quarters of this financial model emerging. And I think we're going to see that continue to pay out for the rest of the year and future years as well that we will benefit from this. And I don't think it's something that's getting pulled forward or pushed back or this or that. It's all zero-based from the bottom. So that's what's exciting and it's a commitment that we have to a new model and a new approach. And also this idea though it's a new way to work. Now in regards to the customer focus I think well we just have never seen customer demand like this and there's certain applications that we've been asked not to profile on the call for example in regards to some things that the US government has done in terms of making sure that stimulus gets to the right place at the right time. And we were asked to do things in a matter of weeks. It's not just limited to our government. It's other governments. It's other businesses. I mean I've never seen and I said this in the last couple of calls so many what I would call emergency deployments. Usually they say hey we like to have this in six months 12 months the most 18 months. That's one of the reasons they come to Salesforce. Very fast time to value this is critical. But for us they want instant time to value. We're like wait we have to build this in the cloud. We don't go - we got to go. All right we'll build. We'll build it. We'll deliver this. We'll make this happen for you. And I've been so fortunate to have Gavin really by my side during all of this. I mean everybody knows Gavin's tremendous lineage. And Gavin and I worked together have been friends for more than a decade. But of course as the CEO of BT I always admired his business process and business practice and his ability to bring discipline. But now watching him run our customer organization and what he's done now over the last year that's just been a shock to me. But Gavin I think you should just kind of come in here because it's not just Amy who's re-imagined the financial model. You've re-imagined the entire customer model and how we're going to market and the balance of sales and service and you've re-imagined the level of management that we have and where we're putting that management level of capacity the relevance the participation I mean the enablement these things that you've laid in. So would you just tell us - give us what's happening on the customer side? And how do you see the market today?All right. And I really want to ask a follow-up question Gavin because you mentioned this but I think it's important to illuminate this which is Q1 was very much frictionless. We decided we're going to do digital kickoffs. We're going to get all of the quotas and the territory assignments out as quickly as possible. You've really led this amazing program to do this and to make sure we have this fast start to the first quarter into the fiscal year. You brought a level of discipline into the sales org I've never seen before. So I never really understood how the British did it. So let me just -- if you just fill in the detail there in terms of the velocity of the distribution organization is just incredible.It's inspiring Gavin. And I'll tell you we've had a lot of great distribution leaders in our company and a lot of great people by my side over the last two decades who have been running this distribution organization but you've just done an incredible job. And I just want to congratulate you on not only a great year last year but now just this amazing first quarter and the execution you've done. Amy do you want to just come in here now go into details? Because this velocity that Gavin has given us well now you're really paying it out with this new model aren't you?And I'll give you a point of evidence on that which is that Gavin and I brought our top distribution leaders together in person last week with Bret. And we can't bring them all in person. So some of them are just not allowed in the United States. We just can't get them here. But for the ones that can come in like Gavin for example or others we even were able to bring in some of our European executives. Wow I mean it was really a position of confidence. It was feeling like there is a tremendous market that has built over last year that I think people realize that they must be digital but they must be digital with their customers. It's not just digital transformation. It's digital customer transformation. That's where the power is I believe in the market especially right now. And I love that Sonos story because it's point of evidence on that. Would you agree?Well I'll tell you that you're right. I mean this was the best quarter we've ever had and I can tell you from bringing these distribution leaders in I've never seen a pipeline like this or the ability in every market to execute with such robustness. And I think the CEOs -- I mean I'll tell you from my own. Obviously we invested last year. We didn't pull back. We knew we had to go for it. And we had to go all out. And it's counterintuitive. The world is ending and you have to say well you got to go all out and realize that the world is not going to be ending in a year from now. And it's hard when you're in it because people start to panic. It's a normal human reaction. I mean we even had executives in Salesforce who came in and said """"Oh we've got to cut. We got to do this. We have to do that."""" We reshaped. There's no question we did some slight reshaping but we didn't do any massive layoffs or anything like that of any consequence that I would say oh we really tried to cut dramatically in some area or whatever. It was like no we need to reshape to grow. We need to invest to grow. We need to do the things that we need to do as a company and that's a year ago. So a year ago it was a decision based on experience that is we have seen it whether it was the recession of 2001 or the financial disasters of 2008. Those are just moments. They're moments in time but in the history of the company or if you look at the history of the equity from 2004 when we went public you got to keep going. And that moment is the time to go because in many cases your competitors are pulling back because they're afraid. And when your competitors are afraid that's when you need to invest and that's where you really need to grow. And I'll tell you I think that that's what Gavin did that Gavin came in and he reshaped. He took out some cost. He advanced certain areas. He rebalanced his org and was able to provide greater market coverage and expanding his capacity capability and I think at levels I haven't seen in a long time. So do you want to just fill in the details?Well I'll tell you I think to add to that I mean you look at what Bret has done this year. I mean Bret really led and executed this amazing reshaping plan. He rebuilt the kind of the company overall really looking at where are we balancing our resource and also architecting our Slack acquisition. Bret was at the tip of the spear on both of those making sure that we're prepared for the future with the business plan and the reshaping plan that we needed and the technology plan and the technology vision. Then Amy came in and she said no we're going to rebuild the fundamental financial plan as well and we're going to couple that financial plan from the bottom up and build a new revenue plan and a new cash flow and margin plan. And you see that now. And then we had Gavin come in and say this is how we're going to rebuild the distribution organization. And I think these three tiers all coming together really are what you see today. And when you look at these numbers when you look at a company that's going to do now over $26 billion in revenue this year look there's only been a couple of enterprise software companies in history have done that. You know that. And this is a big moment for us $26 billion. But you know because you have your models and you have your spreadsheets and you have your formulas and you see our growth rates you can start to project out and see where we're going not only this year and next year but as we're projecting out to our $50 billion number which obviously we're excited about and we're thrilled.",0.002706051,0.003071249,0.000219342
27,27,BAC,Moynihan:,Glenn I think just generally Fed has a task to bringing inflation out of the system. And our GDP assumptions like partner team they are for the economy the slowest growth rate from this year to next year. The question of great debate is a soft lining hard lining et cetera. But I think what's unusual this time is how much cash is sitting in the consumers' accounts. If you are sitting here when they start normalizing rates in the middle of the last decade late to middle last decade you wouldn't have seen the consumer balances sitting with those multiples I gave you earlier in their accounts and then having tremendous borrowing capacity left in terms of unused credit lines and the same on the commercial side Lines are bouncing along just above the low point. And so we continue to adjust our reserve levels to as Alastair said to factor in our base case includes higher inflation through the rest of the year. And next year our seats reserves set by that base case which is a 40% weighting to adverse frankly equal maybe 40% of the actual reserves we have because the rest are judgmental and in precision and things like that. So we're very strong in reserve. And we're very mindful that I think it's very different to think about the situation where the consumers unemployment is already so low and the consumers are sitting with money. And I think that puts more attention on the Fed to how they architect a successful change and they know that. But on the other hand it's a better place to start.Yes. And Alastair gave you some detail. But just simply put John we expect to be relatively flat for 2022 versus 2021. That's the guidance we gave you last quarter. We don't see any different this quarter.And John just you said operating leverage. I'm proud of the team. We have three straight quarters of operating leverage. PPNR growth was strong. That's different than what we've seen out there generally. But remember during the -- as the rates rose in the pre-pandemic softening and hard landing and inherently ways in everybody's mind the simple fact is we had 20 straight quarters of operating leverage and we're starting to see that come through. And if you look at the consumer efficiency from the first quarter last year this quarter your point in efficiency ratio this has all come through NII and it all falls to the bottom-line. And therefore you end up with a fairly significant impact in those businesses which are obviously highly sensitive growth in NII.Mike those are all the pieces. But simply put I think Alastair said NII pick up next quarter. So you pick up the $200 million this quarter you put that in the bank then you pick up another $600 million plus next quarter and then it grows with net out. So yes that's tremendous operating leverage. And as we just said to John expenses are flat. So that flows through the bottom line. All the different vagaries of not only regulatory accounting versus GAAP accounting but also what cap the comp and the capital ratio calculation versus not at the end of the day you said $1.4 trillion. It's $2 trillion of deposits $1.4 trillion just on the consumer -- for people side of the business. And even on the business side we only have operational deposits. And so the end of the day those are very long deposits. We extract the value through investing and that's why we put it in held the maturity. And the cash flow of that head to maturity portfolio is $20-odd billion a quarter even in a rate environment changes. So that -- whatever hit we had the CET1 the growth in NII and the growth in earnings power and hat covers up inside of a year. And so we feel very good about that. So the rate environment where we come off the zero floors makes us a lot more money. You know that and we know that.On the consumer side the people being Wealth Management consumers and general consumers the $1.4 trillion were 40% or more in checking accounts and that's the money people have in motion in a given day. And what the big volume of comes from frankly you have 35 million checking holders which is a new record for us. And so that's important. And all the feature functionality helps them our retention for our preferred customer base and the consumer segment which represents 70% or 80% of all the deposits is 99-point something. And so those customers stay with us a long time. What I meant operational accounts on the commercial side we -- all the cash is money in motion for those commercial customers meaning it's part of the data cash flow. So whether it's small business customers whether it's business banking customers which are under $50 million revenue companies or even middle market this money is coming in and out every day. And so it's very stable. It doesn't disappear from the scenes. And if you look at our GTS revenue you can see the Global Transaction Services revenue on the -- page on Gold Banking you'll see it's grown nicely year-over-year and that's due to the stability of that deposit base and what we see. So it's not going to move away from the balance sheet. That's the point I said about -- in a rate rising cycle last rate rising cycle as money supply shrink at the end of the day we grew deposits 5%. And so we'll see what happens because it's different but we feel pretty confident.So Betsy remember coming into the pandemic we had hit the point where we brought expenses down and said we â€“ now we're an operating leverage company so we'll get revenue growth faster than expense growth but we'd start to grow modestly. Then the pandemic had a lot of expenses coming in and out. But â€“ and so when we say flat year-over-year basically meaning '23 versus '22 in that $59 billion to $60 billion range our view is that our goal is to keep that down to a modest expense growth if any and as we move to '24 etcetera. but we are fighting all those discussion you had. But the key is to have the revenue grow much faster. And that's what we expect to see as NII kicks back up and efficiency ratios as Mike or John referenced ought to kick back down pretty nicely.Yes. So the piece that will matter the most will be the AFS securities. And we've talked before about the fact that we have about 200 billion of treasuries there and they're all swapped to floating precisely to insulate us. So I think that's one of the reasons you see our AOCI hit is much smaller than many others. So then it's just a question of managing around the $50 billion or so of securities that we have there that aren't swapped to floating. And I'd just note that that number has come down a little bit months after months after months. I think it will keep coming down. We have some ability obviously to hedge that if we choose to. And so we'll manage our interest rate exposure as the environment develops from here.Yes. The question always is if the Fed is hiking rates because of inflation that they can't get back under control and you got to look at the stuff out everybody focused on NII you got to look at what's going on in the economy generally. So that's why we have significant reserves in case it's harder landing than people at the Fed would like to engineer. And that's why we run the company with such a balance. But generally a higher sustained rate environment will help us earn a lot more money. And you saw that pick up as we picked up through 2016 2017 2018 and you'll see it happen. Again you've already seen it happen. Then we think last year first quarter this year first quarter we had $1.4 billion more NII per quarter. So that's -- it's already helped and as loan and deposit growth are matched with some modest rate increases.No. We said 2022 is flat to 2021 and then grow modestly then.So I think that -- we made progress each quarter basically. We're around the 66% we're down year-over-year. I think if I gave you the specific quarter we crossed over basically to the earnings projection for the rest of the quarter. So Erika I think just as you look at the businesses you're starting to see them drop more in line. Obviously we always have such a huge Wealth Management business which 27% pre-tax margin which is industry-leading it was up 30% last quarter will impact that because it's a bigger part of our business than others but you'll see relentless progress but I can't give the exact quarter.Important in the small business area originations are strong and back past pre-pandemic levels of quarterly originations and you're seeing home equity come back up even though mortgage will fall off. I think pre-pandemic we did $3 billion. So we have a room on the consumer side and on the commercial side for further loan growth as the -- as people sort of normalize their behaviors and activities. And now you all read about the car industry the line uses a car. Car auto dealers is really low and it's just as an example they can't keep enough inventory on the line.Yes. Well I think we're wise to do that. When it comes to the card side I'd say flattish. We're managing to the total client relationship there. That remains something that we're focused on total we'll see some growth there. We'll see it in balances. We'll see it in NII mostly and we'll see it in detail in elsewhere. On the asset management side mostly it will be around market levels. So we'll follow that as you will closely. And a little bit of net new household growth and flows growth again this year. So that's how we're thinking about it. But I would say across all kind of flattish slightly maybe slightly up. The only one thing to bear in mind is just as a reminder on insufficient funds and overdraft. Just remember that those that started to kick in in February and the remainder will pass through in March. So that's probably like -- sorry May and that's probably a $750 million hit for the year if you like on total fees.Steven the dynamics is going to be how big the wealth management business sits as a percentage of the total and just the dynamic set business. And that's always what constrained it even to the rest of the businesses. If I remember a peak cycle both Global Banking went well-below 50 Consumer went well below 50 and then between markets and Wealth Management. Now Wealth Management has done a great job of growing its loans and deposits so that will help it. But that's always going to be the debate and you should be cheering for strong Wealth Management revenues even if it means a little less efficiency ratio.It's actually the opposite of that. They grew faster from February to March and that's probably because of the tax returns that they have. But basically the broad way to think about it is beginning around May of last year they grew 1% not annualized but 1% per month pretty consistently 1% to 2% higher at the lower end balances. Only in the month of November I think we saw a slight down draft in the lower end balances and that picked back up in December grew January February March each month. It grew this quarter and the March month was the strongest. So we might -- we haven't seen the data for April yet but it's growing very strong all the way up into the people who carried pre-pandemic at $10 000 to $20 0 our balances are still growing in very strongly. So we're not seeing that deteriorate at all yet.It all comes down to deposits. We keep growing deposits we got to put it to work. So Alastair can give you more detail. But you remember what drives the size of our balance sheet so our right-hand side not our left. And so at $2 trillion -- we grew $200 billion -- or $180 billion $190 billion deposits last year first quarter this year first quarter. So if we grow our deposits which you should be cheering for on the core basis we do we will then invest those deposits in a careful way.The new revenues will generate more margin profit Mike. And the efficiency ratio let's always see where we get to but it will keep coming down and we are improving every â€“ all the way through into the pandemic and with operating leverage every quarter. And I think it's not going back and checking it quarter-by-quarter. I think it improved every quarter. It leaves aside some seasonality. But yes we will keep driving it down. Headcount if this quarter was down another 100 people it was down 4 000 last year. We are adding salespeople. We're opening new branches. We're investing in franchise. We've opened in the 7 8 10 markets and we have $30 billion of new deposits in those branches to give you a sense and there's only 140 branches. You know our strategy Mike. So it's always going to come down to balancing all that. But at the end of the day we're saying expenses are flat this year and NII improvement is going to flow to the bottom line. That's a pretty strong impact to efficiency especially because it's going through the businesses even the wealth management business.I think you're a good critic of and observer of banks Mike but the reality is we have economists predict recessions and all the outages about them. But the -- and the reality is they always have a prediction for recession that runs around 10% 20% according to economists activity. But let me flip to what you really said which is we weighted the adverse scenario factor at a 40% factor in our baseline reserve setting. That produced a formulaic reserve which is around 40% of our total reserves. And so we have reserves on top of that basis for tough times. So I'm not going to chat a box with you about soft landing hard landing and all that stuff. But the reality is they've got to take the inflation out of system. They know that. The rising rates do that. But there's tensions against how easy or hard thatâ€™s going to be obviously pandemic war but also this issue that the massive amount of stimulus is still out there being spent. So we're braced for every scenario. We model every scenario but we don't -- I don't put a specific percentage. I just -- that's somebody else's job to do that but our economists do not have a recession predicted in terms of this year it's around 3% growth next year a little over 2%. And even though there may be some quarters that would show modest growth I think they're all positive so I got it right.Gerard how are you?We don't. Well Gerard just to start we -- basically you know this as well as anybody having been around this industry for a number of years let's just say. At the end of the day the reason why we have securities investments is because we have $2 trillion of deposits and $1 trillion of loans. And so we got to do something with the money and that deposits are stable. They're core checking accounts. They're your core operating cash for commercial customers. So we put it to work to extract the value for the shareholders. And so it's not that we lean the balance sheet. It's as we do all the work we do in the core franchise to grow the number of customers 10% or 15% since pre-pandemic and core consumer checking customers to grow the commercial customer base small business base et cetera that results in us having a balance sheet that is positioned to benefit in rising rates because we have so much zero cost deposits. And so we don't sit there and say let's move the balance sheet. What we do is we try to protect in a cautious way all the risks. So we hedge the couple -- a year or so 1.5 years ago. There were a lot of questions about oh my gosh you're investing and rates are low. And we told people we hedge it and now you're seeing the benefits of those hedges. That gave us NII from then until now to protect the capital and that's what we did. So we're always trying to manage extracting the value deposits give and then look to the other side and see the capital constraint question and the impact of capital see other constraints on us. But it's really -- and we only invest in treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. We don't take a credit risk and materials in the treasury book for lack of a better term because we take enough of the end company. So I just don't -- we don't sit there and say 'Let's move around.' It's just how do we invest this and we may move a little shorter or longer on what we invest in. But frankly we swapped a lot of it to short just to protect ourselves so that we'd be able to redeploy to higher rates in the future.I think. We're growing through it because it has ways it's calculated that are not sensitive to our size relative to the economy stock price all these kinds of things in it that move it around a little bit but the reality is that wouldn't -- when we look at the core customer base we wouldn't constrain core customer growth. We can always make efficiencies and move stuff around and we saw -- believe it or not as you can see in the other category of loans which in that quarter our franchise still left over frankly from 15 17 years ago or have that was that we can let run off and stuff like that or sell out and stuff. But the reality is that the G-SIB buffer is growing because our customer franchise is getting bigger in a method of calculation does not adjust for business success size of economy stock market cap increase all those things which I think you have a pretty good favor of Gerard. So we're going to have to retain 50 basis points more capital. So divide that 50 basis points by seven quarters and think about us pulling that through. The question of buffers to that number yes you should expect us to operate closer to that 10.75% just because frankly the number is getting so big that we've never had an issue of the size of capital implied by that buffer to the minimum regulatory minimum.And that capital â€“ as the earning style of the franchise generated 15.5% return on tangible common equity this quarter and we'll continue to go up -- continue to be strong based on NII improvement.And just the cash flow of the portfolio even in a very low prepayment rate scenario you got to remember people pay principal interest people pass away and then people move irrespective of mortgage rates refinancing. And those numbers all that cash can be redeployed at the higher rate structure. So it turns a little faster than people think because everybody takes to zero prepayments but the cash flow off of it is fairly significant. So we'll redeploy that and walk back up the ladder. But -- and also remember economically if we don't market deposit this is one of the great debates we've all had it not for accounting for banks. But the end of the day the deposits are growing economically at a much faster rate than the degradation on the mortgage-backed portfolio.I think that's all our questions. Thank you for joining us again this quarter. It's a strong quarter by the team and I want to thank the team for all the great work they've done. At the end of the day as we told you last quarter and a few quarters before that the organic growth machine in Bank of America is driving hard growing its market share growing its deposits growing its loans and doing well in the market. We will accelerate the P&L from that growth with the higher rates as we told you. We'll continue to hold expenses in check driving operating leverage and that will always be a focus to get the most efficient growth we can. The strong customer activity which we spoke about continues even in the first part of April here. And so that would end up drive -- it's good for our company to drive our earnings. So thank you. We look forward to talking to you next time.,0.005812387,0.026013613,0.00725619
28,28,ACN,Sweet:,Sure. I think a big aspect of it is embracing the need for speed. And so you are continuing to see more and more companies doing the compressed transformation the willingness to take on more at the same time and even to do that faster. And just think we have a couple of calls I had just this past week clients that we've been working with on some -- for some time speaking about their cloud journey I wouldnâ€™t call me up Monday and say okay we're going to pull forward Wave 2. We've got to go faster. It's harder than we thought we need to go faster. And in so there's this as companies are kind of getting into it they're seeing that they want to go even faster they're also seeing the impact of those who come ahead. I was recently talking to the CEO of a company where we're doing a major cloud and data platform and his point so as we speak okay now I get it I can only go so fast but can you go faster because I now see what I can really do one side replatform right. And so this embracing more change and speed we do think is helping drive this demand. And we predicted the sort of -- remember we talked about compressed transformation that it's really only been in about a third of industries and that it was going to continue to expand. But the point is the first round of compressed transformation is just the first round. And as you begin to see the power of what it is to be in the cloud the next steps of opportunities are being seen by the clients. And so I do think it's mostly around a recognition of the value of replatforming and the need for speed competitively.Happy holidays.Sure. So there's really no change Jason to anything that we're seeing in duration or in conversion. I mean it all depends on the mix of the work that we're selling. But every individual type of service there's no change within those durations or mixes. And then just in terms of what we're seeing for the full year I'll just comment on the type of work we see. Consulting strong double digits even probably stronger than what we saw obviously at the beginning of the year. And outsourcing now a double-digit growth.Yes and it's probably worth reminding what KC said earlier right our expectations were exceeded across all sizes. And obviously when small deals are also over delivering that in quarter revenue right. So it's really -- it is broad based.Well sure. I mean so first of all you just have to remember scale right. So Accenture Cloud First was a $12 billion business. Our cloud business overall is $12 billion business is down $80 billion business right. So that's what we announced last quarter. And so when cloud is very strong double-digit growth is obviously adding big dollars but across each of the strategic priorities. So obviously it would be a different scale. But look you have to look at the cloud right? Because the cloud is the enabler. Think about it this cloud is the enabler data is the driver and then AI will be the differentiator for our clients. And so you saw many many of the examples really bringing these things together right so that you've got to get to the cloud you got to get a handle on your data right and then be able to use AI. And we saw that in many of the examples that I gave in the script today. And so the first big step is of course replatforming in the cloud both through migration and SaaS [ph] products. So just if you kind of have that mental model I think it's helpful and then that goes across the organization.Sure. So a few things right. So -- and we shared this last quarter that if you look at -- you have to build your digital core right? So if you look at platforms like Oracle SAP and they're moving to the cloud those are all well below 50% of their installed base having moved right? The sort of move to the cloud itself the percentages are still around 30%-ish maybe a little bit more in terms of workloads that have moved to the cloud right? So if you just sort of look at kind of where are we just technically right you see a lot of waves. Then you look at our own research where we talked about leaders and leapfroggers. And what we see is that about 10% on average of every company are really leaders and performing much better than the bottom 25%. But that's only still a part of their organization. They're still working on lots of compressed transformation you've got these leapfroggers are coming from behind that's about -- we estimate about a third are really doing compressed transformation. And those compressed transformation is wave on wave right. Once you get to the cloud and what do you do with the data. So we continue to see this as really being a multiyear journey. And I will tell you that a lot of people will talk about the pandemic accelerated years of transformation into months. That's only in thinking right? It is really hard to re-platform right. And then -- and it's really hard to move get your data under control and then be able to do that. Once you do it it opens up so much. But there's a lot of hard work for our clients ahead and we're privileged to get to be their partner.Well that's always -- we talk about that with our clients all the time right? Because look the supply chain problems there's kind of the immediate issues but there's the longer term issues like the ports are not up to snuff in most of the markets around the world right? There's fundamental shifts going on in terms of how do you get -- how do you build resilience which has been moving from sort of cost to resilience. And so the work of supply chain is multi year. But I think it's important just -- I always go back to kind of where we were. The new technologies have really only come online some of the newer platforms like Blue Yonder Luminate or SAP. As for supply chain work in the last couple of years right. And so they're just starting to really get the momentum and the implementation. And so I would say the digital supply chain work is very very early innings and the same with manufacturing. That's why we call it the next frontier. It's a big focus. I mean I think Gartner had a survey that said 93% or 91% of directors believe it's the biggest transformation opportunity. But we're in very very early innings still.Happy holidays.Yes it's really a function of what we've been talking about it's compressed transformation right? It's a function of more clients taking on more change right because that's what builds this level of bookings. And we've been talking about that trend really from the first 6 months after the pandemic where we had more clients do over $100 million bookings in the first 6 months of that fiscal year. And we continue to see that building as clients recognize how much change they need to do and that they have to go faster. So that's really what we see is the function.Thanks Bryan. Okay. I think that was our last question. So thank you for joining us on today's call. And thank you again to our really incredible people across the globe. And thanks to all of our shareholders for your continued trust. We work to earn it every day and we really appreciate it. So best wishes to all for a safe healthy and joyful holiday season.,0.002979398,0.004030466,0.000643528
29,29,NFLX,Anmuth:,And what are the benchmarks or milestones perhaps that you need to see around gaming to lean in even more here in terms of content budget? And are there any metrics or numbers that you can provide so far?Okay. Ted Netflix shares are back to of course back to pre-COVID levels but they're also around the same level they were at nearly 4 years ago in 2018. So maybe you could just talk about your ability to continue to hire great talent within the company.Okay. I wanted to -- just back to content for a minute. You've driven a lot of attention to Formula 1 with Drive To Survive. Given the success there sports is obviously a frequent topic how are you thinking about sports? There's certainly more rumblings around doing things related to NFL media and NFL films. How are your intentions shifting perhaps here at all?Okay. And then just to close out. Reed you've created this very unique very successful culture within the company over the past 20-plus years. Has anything changed in your view just from a cultural perspective around either content acquisition or in some of the more operational functions?Okay. Great. Thank you all.,0.002519548,0.002519548,0
30,30,LIN,Lamba:,I'm going to kind of touch on the principle of that and just kind of tell you how we look at that business every day essentially Jeff as you've probably heard me say it before. So when we think about how we manage our business and how we leverage what comes at the top line right down to the bottom we think about it coming through our variable margin. So that's where the productivity measures kick in and then tight management of total cash fixed costs. That's something that gets attention every month. It's something that our guys are managing every day. And as part of that the sales and admin costs are something where we spend a lot of time scrutinizing. Now how does productivity play a role over there? Jeff you've heard me talk about digital solutions previously. One of the things we do extremely well around our productivity actions particularly when it comes to the fixed cost piece is actively provide a lot of digital solutions into that space to make sure you're automating to make sure that you're taking out where possible you're taking our heads were possibly taking out effort. And I think all of that plays into that effort around managing your total cash fixed cost and within that the subset being SG&A. I won't say to you that's rocket science there Jeff. It's just the grind of managing that every day.I could get excited by rocket but we'll talk about that later.Thanks Nicola. So let me start off by just talking about the energy diversity actions that are happening across Europe in particular as we speak and the role we could play in that. So we have actually as you think about it as more capacity gets released on the engineering side we have now the ability to go out and provide a greater focus around supporting governments and countries in their search for that energy diversity. So I clearly see us playing a role around the LNG development that happens given that we have that core competence around that. And obviously we are in dialogue at the moment with a number of governments in looking and developing projects that will help support that. Now that does take a little bit of time. As you know these are complex projects but we are pleased that we have a role to play in there. Of course EUs focus and the rebar kind of effort and policy statements clearly have set out the intent of how that diversified energy portfolio will become crucial. We talked a little bit about clean hydrogen earlier on. I do see that in all our discussions that we're having with a number of these governments that that intent will translate into action. I have to tell you that I am a little more optimistic now that there will be a role between green and blue. I think the recognition around the fact that blue hydrogen or blue ammonia will provide a good bridge to ultimately go in green which is what we think a pragmatic policy direction would look like. I am seeing that there is a little more traction to that. And there is a general realization that scale up on blue can happen more quickly. Now all of this does mean however that there will be a combination of local projects many of which will be green and imported in the elements of carriers that will provide either ammonia as an energy source as an example or hydrogen itself either piked or in liquid form. And we see again that there's greater openness to understanding how those logistical challenges will get dealt with across countries and kind of setting out regimes just as Germany has using contract for differences as an example to try and make sure that they get access to these developments that happen elsewhere in the world allowing that import market to actually be set up and build the infrastructure that then allows that distribution of that energy to take place as well. So all in I'd say to you that Linde has a role to play both from a point of view of the engineering that we can provide into that space and also in participating in the kind of downstream efforts that happen once that energy is made available. So I do feel good about that. I have to be honest and tell you though that all of this does take longer than people would like it to take. All of us would like to see this happen in the next few months but unfortunately these things tend to take years rather than months. Now just talking about the energy curtailment piece that you briefly referenced. Obviously as you would expect we have a business company planning effort in Europe across most of our countries in fact. And in Germany in particular we have run a number of different scenarios. We are actively engaged with both the power and natural gas providers but also for the governments locally. There is a -- as you would appreciate there is a part of our business the air separation side where we are providing crucial products including medical oxygen to hospitals which gets prioritized by government. So we appreciate that they understand that criticality of that. And then on the other side we don't have any direct exposure to Russian natural gas but we do recognize that some of our customers will do that and we are kind of working with governments and customers to make sure that we have those contingency plans in place. I can also -- I know the Polish example is top of mind for everyone. Just to give you a kind of sense on that from our perspective we will see a little more impact from those developments.Sure. So thanks Nicola. I appreciate that question. I'm going to talk about Rocket for get excited about it and then touch on helium a little bit and wrap it up. So as far as rockets are concerned aerospace for us represents about 2% of our sales. And at some point I think we're going to designate its own end market. It's been growing strong double digits for us for quite some time. And Linde is the largest supplier in this entire sector. So we're quite proud of that. Our rockets consume many gases. And while it's primarily liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen some helium often liquid nitrogen for densification of the fuel that is used. We also use Crypton and Xenon to help satellites with their propulsion systems to keep them in orbit. In addition to that the reason I get excited is because here we're able to bring a full benefit of Linde's portfolio and we provide atomized powders for advanced manufacturing or 3D printing as it were for specific components and parts. And we also provide some specialized coatings out of our PST unit. So all in it's kind of a comprehensive package of solutions that we can bring to these companies. And obviously they greatly appreciate that. And I expect this to grow as you can see from the number of launches you see in the news every other week now. So it's a good growth market. We are excited about it. We have some great tremendous solutions over a year and that really positioned us extremely well and the U.S. market is growing leaps and bounds. On Helium itself as you know Helium is short. There are two major components at the moment kind of driving that. There is BLM in the U.S. which has the most significant impact. And most people were banking on some helium coming out of Amur in Russia. And we recognize that that's going to be delayed. So it's likely for the rest of this year. I expect helium to remain quite tight. We're obviously seeing that incremental costs and pricing reflect a lot of that as we speak. So from our perspective we didn't have any Russian helium in our sourcing last year. We have a good balance of sources across the world multiple sources to exactly manage these kinds of issues that ultimately come up. So managing dozens of sources ensuring that we kind of mitigate that risk and meeting our customers' needs is really kind of where helium is at and we're seeing pricing trends hold up. I expect that to hold up for the rest of the year as well given the tightness in the market.Thanks Peter. So that is the point I was making that I was really pleased to see how resilient the merchants i.e. the bulk and the package side of the business has been right through the first quarter despite the fact that we had to put significant price increases through as a result of the energy cost increase that we saw. So that's held up reasonably well Peter I'm hesitant to try and speculate what that market might do. There are of course a number of variables in that market. But I was surprised pleasantly that it had held and been quite resilient. And I have to say that as we move beyond the first quarter that trend hasn't changed in any significant way thus far.All I look at is a volume trend line at the moment Peter and that's not suggesting that for now.Sure John. So let me first clarify health care and then let me talk about some of the other end markets as well. So on health care we saw the trend was flat. And really what I was emphasizing was in the developed countries I'm finding that elective surgeries are increasing. As you know these have been kind of put on hold through the COVID period. They are all coming back. That's where a lot of the oxygen usage is there. And then we're finding COVID volumes offsetting by declining particularly in the emerging markets. So that trend is why we are seeing the flattish kind of volume around the healthcare piece. And I said earlier I expect healthcare will be back at its kind of long-term trend of mid-single digit in due course. Coming back to your other question around pre-COVID levels versus where we are on all our end markets. And I'll say to you more broadly most end markets across most geographies are at or above pre-COVID level. So we've seen good recovery. We've seen that embedded in those different markets. And we've been quite pleased to see that recovery. You saw most of that in 2021 as well. And clearly the momentum as you can see from that Slide 3 that I put up there's a lot of green on that slide which is a good sign as you can see. So if I kind of maybe pick up a couple. Electronics no need to comment on that. As you know it's well above pre-COVID levels and has been highly resilient and continues to grow. And as I said earlier I expect that growth to continue. Momentum around investments is still there and we are winning more than our fair share of that. So I feel good about that. The ones that I think people kind of are watching carefully chemicals and energy again very strong market movement over here. We are finding that 17% year-on-year growth pretty solid number out there John. But also as I think about our footprint in the U.S. and just to emphasize this this is where I see the growth going to be as we go forward. That is crucial because the U.S. refiners and the U.S. chemical companies have a natural advantage from competitive natural gas pricing that gives them that ability to export into market elsewhere where that energy price increases make local production a lot less competitive. And I expect that momentum to continue in the mid- to -- so I'll say next 2 to 5 years if you will. Metals & Mining again impacted really around the Chinese curtailments the dual control policy et cetera which is helping the rest of the world pick production up. And again I am seeing continued investment in that space. We will see some decarbonization efforts happen in that space as well which will provide a different kind of growth for us. But notwithstanding that again we expect to see that continue. Manufacturing is where a lot of people have questions obviously supply chain challenges chip shortages for auto et cetera. And again the underlying growth over there the underlying demand looks solid and we feel good about where that stands today. Obviously we'll have to watch carefully how IP develops and that's going to kind of be driven in part by how manufacturing continues to demonstrate that resilience.Mike the number of projects that held around 300 that I spoke about last quarter as well. What tends to happen is really the portfolio of projects churn quite a bit. As you would expect and we are adding some larger projects. I'm really pleased that on the industrial side I'm seeing a lot more activity. That's right in the wheelhouse. We are incumbent in many of those positions. We are working with existing customers and that really gives me a lot more confidence. And as you know we are very discerning around the projects that we want to do because we feel that we want to have an offtake or part of that kind of contractual positioning around clean energy and then we need to have the ability to be able to serve that whether it's blue or green from technologies that we can access easily and have a demonstrated operational capability on. You put all of that together that's kind of what's leading to that $5 billion number. I wouldn't read too much into $4 billion and $5 billion to be honest. The absolute number is in 20s. We put a fairly stringent probably the adjustment to that portfolio to get to that five. It's likely more than 5 to be honest. And I feel good about the quality of projects we are seeing. And there is -- you're right in pointing out that there is a higher degree of certainty around those as we continue to work with our customers and partners on them.,0.002817521,0.003052652,0.000156039
31,31,ABT,Ward:,"Jeff could you correct that?We are seeing improvement in our coronary business and we are seeing really much of the improvement come in the South and the Southeast where the impact of COVID was the greatest. Our peripheral in hospital business continues to lag. And I think that is largely due to the impact of staffing shortages not only critical staffing shortages but staffing shortages throughout our referral chain actually beginning with primary care and continuing straight through to the interventional healthcare workers themselves. So the referral chain in peripheral in particular for the more let's say in the lower acuity claudicant patients we think has been pretty damaged in the South and Southeast. It will take time to rebuild that channel. We have seen this happen before in relationship to COVID. If you recall in the period right after the COVID crisis had begun there was a quite a large impact to the referral channel there as well and it took six or seven months for that to recover. So we hope that it won't take that long. We hope that it will be geographically isolated to these states that were heavily impacted. But as I have said right now it's really difficult for us to predict that. And it's very difficult for us to predict what that pace might be because we are dealing with just an entirely new set of variables that we hadn't seen before.Margaret I think you did hear that right. I think that that's a reasonable assumption for the OBL growth.Yes.Thanks for that question Margaret. The consolidation is a little bit difficult to exactly predict. I think we see really in any economic environment when you see a significant change in pricing or value you oftentimes do see consolidation with lower smaller players basically moving out of the segment and some of the larger players increasing their volume. In other words becoming higher volume providers of let's say a lower priced service. We have seen that happening. And as you know our strategy over time has really always been to focus on the higher volume OBLs that treat more complex patients. As we look to the future now with these changes in the PFS certainly we think that that strategy has been correct. And we believe that we will see more consolidation more of these patients moving to these higher volume sites. We have been implementing and we are continuing to implement these strategies that will support that segment of our market and these OBLs. I think we also anticipate over time that reimbursement will shift towards let's say a stratification where the more complex patients receive a higher payment rate. And it just simply makes sense that patients with critical limb ischemia let's say are more expensive to care for than let's say a lower acuity claudicant patient. So we believe that our strategy focusing on these high volume accounts that also focus on more complex patients is very well suited for our core technology. It is well suited for the reimbursement environment and we are really well-positioned to support customers as that change now occurs. It's very difficult for us to predict at this time exactly how this transition from the OBL to the hospital or will patients continue to migrate from the hospital setting to the OBL we don't know. The one thing we do know is that the value of atherectomy in the OBL setting remains intact. It still is a procedure that is reimbursed effectively and is reimbursed at a rate that enables physicians to perform these cases. So I hope that answers your question Margaret. We are still in early days and we will continue to give you updates on this as we proceed probably over the course of the next year or so.Yes . The impact is less there but we should expect some of the delay. We have seen a slowdown in the VAC Committee review process in some hospitals. But that said I mean our performance in the first quarter was consistent with our expectations. As we do have high expectations for growth from that segment of our business over time we do think that because of the slowdown in these VAC reviews in Q1 we will see a slowdown in Q2 and beyond because of that. So we are expecting some impact in our ISD segment although probably not as dramatic as what we are seeing in orbital atherectomy.Thank you.Thank you for that question Mike. It's an excellent question. And what we see obviously early on is that physicians when they receive access to a new technology will begin to trial it on a wide variety of patients to see how the product performs in their hands and the procedures that they are performing. This is very common and we have seen this in interventional cardiology over and over and over the years. As they begin to gain experience with the technology and they then have the opportunity to see the ease of use to assess the utility of this new technology in the care of their patients then they can determine both individually and at their center exactly how they want to incorporate that new technology into their traditional care patterns. So that is what we refer to really as trialing. It's that period of time where the physician is evaluating the performance of the product. Now there is other evaluations that are going on as well. The cath lab manager will be assessing the cost. They will be evaluating the economic impact for their hospital setting. And then collectively they make a decision on how they want to proceed. What we are seeing is that after these trialing periods are concluding and in fact as the trialing is going on most oftentimes we are getting our cases. So where physicians are treating longer lesions where they are treating heavily stenotic lesions the requirement for atherectomy remains strong. An IVL balloon cannot remove calcium from the lumen of a vessel as effectively as an atherectomy device can. An atherectomy device also changes the compliance of the vessel and can be used in longer lesions. So these are cases where we will continue to get our cases and these are also circumstances I think that will and have comprised our growth over the years. So we will continue to gain our growth from that. As this trialing settles down we think we will see a return to more normal or more standard practices of care. And in that environment we think we are well-positioned to continue to grow as I indicated in that low double digit range.We have not seen really any change Mike. I think our assessment of where this technology is utilized remains very much the same. We think that the IVLs have and will continue to substantially expand the market. So the vessel preparation market is growing very rapidly because of the success of IVLs. And that is obviously also increasing awareness of calcium. And in time we think that that is going to create somewhat of a tailwind that will also result in just a good and continuously rapidly growing market. In terms of the segmentation our segmentation really has not changed. We still believe that about 10% to 15% of PVI are warranted for care using orbital atherectomy. And those are patients that have multi-vessel disease that have long severely calcified lesions patients that have a high degree of stenosis where for example you simply can't get a balloon through the lesion. And those are the cases that really continue to be our cases and those are cases where an IVL perhaps is not indicated for use. The same would be true in environments where imaging is used. We see continued very strong adoption of atherectomy. And that's largely because the physician is observing the presence of a nodule or they have a much better understanding of what is really happening in the lesion and what would be the most appropriate way to treat it. So for example in Japan where we have a very high rate of adoption of imaging our devices is obviously continuously gaining market share there and we continue to do extremely well in that market. There is a smaller percentage of customers that use imaging in the United States. But in those sites that are high volume sites that are our focused on imaging we also continue to sustain a very strong position.Yes Suraj. Thank you and good morning.Thanks Suraj for those questions. Just in terms of market share I will hand this off to Rhonda in one moment. But I think it's a little bit inappropriate to really be considering market share right now because until we see the IVL in the marketplace begin to annualize it probably is not that relevant to look at market share. As your question even indicates it's very difficult to determine let's say atherectomy only market share in other words the market share of CSI versus Boston Scientific in contrast to what is your market share in the vessel preparation market. And that is where I think we begin to think about how the IVL balloons are really broadening and expanding vessel preparation because IVL balloons can be used by a larger population of physicians and is used in a broader population of patients let's say than just atherectomy. I think the point we are continuously trying to make is that atherectomy retains its position within that treatment continuum while IVL expands vessel prep to a broader population. So exactly how that plays out the reason I say it's going to be important to annualize is that at that time we can really begin to talk about this vessel prep market and then discuss the atherectomy market within the vessel preparation segment. So with that Rhonda I will try to hand it off to you and see if you can address maybe just a little bit more quantitatively.On to your second question Suraj OAS versus IVL economics. As a quick reminder the IVL is not reimbursed in the OBL setting and as a result it really is not utilized there. So that doesn't have any impact in that segment. In peripheral hospital we expect in 2022 that IVL will be reimbursed at a rate equivalent to atherectomy for above the knee lesions. And with the improved economics there we do expect to see some trialing. But once again we anticipate retaining our position in that segment largely because of the unique aspects of our device for the treatment of severely calcified lesions. In the coronaries segment the TPT the recent improvements in reimbursement there clearly have reduced some of the economic barriers to the trialing of IVL. We don't think the economics are an important factor in coronary largely because reimbursement for atherectomy is favorable as it is right now at least the reimbursement for the IVL. So in the coronary segment I think we are seeing an environment that is much more defined by the appropriate indications for use for each of these technologies and economics plays a larger or let's say a smaller role. Over time the IVL right now is a Category III has received a Category III CPT code and that will need to be improved over time in order to let's say rebalance that reimbursement as we get out after the CPT let's say expires. So that is yet to be seen and is quite a long ways in the distance. But nonetheless at this point I would say the economics are probably a level playing field in coronary. Does that answer your question on the economics Suraj?Okay. Thank you. All right. Ryan we will progress to the third question.Suraj I hope that answers your questions. Any additional follow-up there?Okay. Thank you everyone for joining today's call. We look forward to updating many of you at the upcoming Stifel and Canaccord conferences later this month and wish you all a pleasant day. Thank you.""",0.003299981,0.005237997,0.000873553
32,32,AMD,Lisa,Su: Yeah. So Stacy I think the data center business particularly the Server CPU business continues to be very strong for us. I am not going to proclaim a certain will it double every quarter. I can say that we expect to grow very strongly over the next few quarters. And we are continuing to bring on additional supply to do that. The demand is there and it really is about continuing to work with our customers on that. But I think our confidence level in Data Center growth is very high.Su: Yes Stacy. We are expecting that we will grow client revenues on a year-over-year basis in that time environment and we continue to mix shift to letâ€™s call it the more Premium segments and so itâ€™s a revenue share statement.Su: Yes. That is true. But our expectation though is we have a number of growth drivers in the business but in terms of what has allowed us to increase the full year guide from an organic standpoint it is a strong visibility in Server strong visibility on the console side strong visibility just from an overall supply and demand perspective.Su: Yeah. So Aaron obviously it depends on the mix between Cloud and Enterprise but in general as we offer more value letâ€™s call it more performance more capability we would expect our ASP to mix up and in any given quarter itâ€™s more of what is the Cloud versus Enterprise mix. But look I am very pleased with the fact that we are growing both Cloud and Enterprise very substantially. So I think that tells you that we are growing it across the entire Server market and we are going to continue to letâ€™s call it optimize products so that one of our customers get more capability and we get more value for our technology.Su: Yeah. Aaron the way to think about that is so both the Xilinx portfolio and sort of the organic AMD portfolio do use TSMC. So we are complementary there as our primary wafer supplier. We use very similar substrate suppliers as well. The Xilinx portfolio tends to be on more mature nodes although there is some 7-nanometer of the majority of the portfolio is on 60-nanometer and above. So I would say thereâ€™s not much fungibility there. However on the backend on the substrate side there is very good fungibility across the portfolio. And from the standpoint of overall supply I think you have heard from Devinder we have invested significantly over the last 18 months in sort of securing the supply capacity and we are seeing it come online and thatâ€™s again what Iâ€™d like to do is as you see it come online thatâ€™s when it will go into our revenue forecast. But I feel very good about the progress that we are making and we are continued to dimension the company for just a much larger business and so itâ€™s a lot of supply that we are bringing online. And we are working very much with Victor and his team as well because he has strong backlog and strong demand and we are looking to use all of the AMD assets to also accelerate some of his builds.Su: Yeah. So -- Harlan thanks. So we have made great progress on the Cloud side so we have strong adoption on internal as well as external-facing workloads. We have also made strong progress on the enterprise. I mean as you said all major OEMs have EPYC throughout the portfolio. And in this past quarter and in general we have grown the Enterprise business about at the same pace as the Cloud business. We are still Cloud-weighted but I believe that itâ€™s going to be fairly balanced growth across both portfolios.Su: Thanks Harlan.Su: Yeah. Sure Mark. So I think the answer is yes and maybe I will generalize it a bit more. We are a big believer. I mean the whole strategy behind AMD is to have the best sort of compute engines and then put them together sort of in solutions for specific end markets. So I think our CPUs GPUs the FPGAs the adaptive SoCs and then the DPU that we are adding from Pensando give us just a tremendous range of capability. So to your specific question and sort of Comms Infrastructure I definitely think thereâ€™s a strong opportunity there. As Victor mentioned we have been to a number of our joint large customers and there is absolute interest in trying to put these solutions together. And more broadly though I think what we see in terms of growth going forward that there will be more customization around solutions for large -- for these large customers whether itâ€™s Cloud customers or large telcos or even some edge opportunities. And having these compute engines will allow us to basically optimize those solutions together. So we look forward to telling you sort of a lot more about sort of how we are thinking about these roadmaps as we go into our financial Analyst Day in June.Su: Yes. Mark so the software is very very important. And software across all of those engines is important and Xilinx comes with a very strong software stack. We have our own software stack. You will see is unify that and that will be an important part of our roadmap going forward. And to your open-source point we do believe in open-source. We think collaboration is an important part of the ecosystem as well. So all of those are things that we are working on to provide more complete solutions for our customers.Su: Yeah. Sure. Ross thanks for the question. So for the second quarter in particular the second quarter guide is driven by sort of one is the full quarter of the Xilinx business and strength in our server business primarily as we see the second quarter. There are other puts and takes I would call them on the smaller side of that. If you recall I mean if you think about whether you think about the PC business or the gaming business they tend to be more second half-weighted so the second quarter doesnâ€™t tend to be a strong quarter for those businesses and so thatâ€™s not the driver of the sequential increase.Su: I am not sure that I see a quote-unquote plateau Ross so I wouldnâ€™t say that. What I would say though is if I give you sort of the puts and takes of the second half of the year that the -- again we expect that the server business will continue to grow as we said good visibility there. We expect the console business to grow in the second half versus first half also. Thatâ€™s typical seasonality. Typical seasonality in PCs would also have the second half higher than the first half. I think we are modeling for a little bit sub seasonal just given sort of all the puts and takes in the market there. And then we expect the Xilinx business to also grow in the second half as more supply comes online given the strong demand. So if you see all those pieces I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a plateau. I think itâ€™s a continued improvement as we see one strong demand and also more supply coming online in the second half of the year.Su: No one ever apologizes to me. So thatâ€™s really nice Ross.Su: Yeah. Sure Tim. So without going into the exact numbers I would say the Semi-Custom business is a strong growth driver. We have -- we work with these customers very closely. We have good views of where they think the demand is. We are still in a place if you were to look into the retail channel you would say that the demand is underserved today in the Semi-Custom business and their real build is towards holiday. So the answer is we do believe that Semi-Custom will be at a record for us this year. We have more content. We also have the Valve Steam Deck that also has gotten very strong reviews and is ramping as we go into the second half of the year. And then on 2023 I do believe that 2023 will be another strong year for Semi-Custom and would be up. And again if you look at the history of these ramps itâ€™s really around the fourth year that you see -- that you really see the business kind of hit its peak. In addition to that just knowing some of the game releases that are -- from a software standpoint that are coming out there are -- there is -- obviously thereâ€™s a good line of software also and [ph] expected strong lineup as we go forward. So yes thatâ€™s our current view of the Semi-Custom business.Su: I would say Tim we havenâ€™t seen that. We havenâ€™t seen that particular phenomena. What we do see is that there needs to be good planning. So good planning with our Server customers and our large cloud customers and we are doing that. And our planning extends beyond 2022 extends into 2023 as well and from what we can see itâ€™s robust demand.Su: Yeah. Absolutely. Let me start Brett and then I will ask Victor to also make some comments. No question AI is a huge opportunity for us and itâ€™s one where we are thinking about it very holistically in terms of how we address. So on the Server CPU side a lot of inference is done on the server CPU side. We have been investing in that area. On the GPU side for both training and inference there a lot of it is around the software stack and so our focus is on optimizing our software stack with our large cloud customers and partners. And then what Xilinx brings to our portfolio is actually a lot of capability on the AI inference side in their current portfolio and then additive to the AMD portfolio. So I think you will see a much broader set of offerings from us in AI as we start talking about sort of the broader product roadmaps. And maybe Victor you want to give some more?Su: Yeah. I think Brett maybe itâ€™s a broader conversation about our overall Software strategy. But as Victor mentioned the unified Software capabilities around AI are very very important. We also have with the acquisition of Pensando they have a very strong Software team and effort around their GPUs and what we can do there. So I think as a total you should see us investing a lot more in Software. And then in terms of the monetization and stuff I think we can address that more as we think about the overall solution space that will be offering across all of these compute engines. And again much more --- great conversation that we can have as we come into our Financial Analyst Day in June.,0.004641688,0.009717345,0.002572661
33,33,CMCSA,Roberts:,Let me -- and Mike said it perfectly. I think that 1 other point to filter here thing is that we have consistently segmented the marketplace and that we have had great offers in multiple segments and low-income constrained segments. We've done it for a long period of time. So everything that Mike said but we're comfortable in terms of working with customers always. We always do that. So if there's -- if we have roll-offs and things like that we've been doing this for a long period of time. So the only other thing in seasonality I think there will be ongoing normalization around things like -- example is Florida. People will leave what we're seeing just leaving a little bit early. And so that is going to happen over time won't be a sudden onetime moment in seasonality but it will just continue we believe to get back to some normal trending and student activity as well so That's it. Mike do you want to add?So the one thing I would just add this is Brian is something that I'm proud of that I think we -- if you look for one of our goals is to grow your businesses. Every one of our businesses just reported that think about the future by investing. And so we're -- whether it's the JV or the broadband investments the Peacock investments things we're doing at Sky buying back stock increasing the dividend we're doing all those things simultaneously. And I think that is something that differentiates us.Well let me start Jessica. Nice to hear your voice. I think we have a -- we've anticipated the changes in video pretty well. And on the one side I think part of NBC's media results are that the decline is actually less because there are new ways for people to get video. And from the Cable side we have our highest margins our best quarter in EBITDA and revenues and the companies continue to grow because we pivoted the strategy. So -- and our satisfaction scores are at all-time highs. So we're giving customers choices and we found a way to get ourselves to a place of unique and in different so that we're not trying to push something on to a customer that perhaps is a rock up a hill that we don't want to have to do. So that strategy has worked for us. So as I think forward I think we believe aggregation is a real opportunity on to see customers who have now so many more choices. And there's -- they just want to get to the content they want really fast and in a seamless way and somebody who makes it work for them. And we're seeing viewing patterns change. And we were just talking before the call about one of our shows on NBC at Peacock something about PAM. Not only that come out of the dateline franchise inside the NBC IP kind of redefined video if you will out of the News business and the Dateline franchise. The first airing if you just went off a traditional television rating you might have one conclusion. And as you've watched the show grow now with on-demand with Peacock and with NBC Dateline Special and you put all that together the show's really successful. So having a company that can do all those things across both on all of the platforms NBCUniversal has positioned us. So I think we now take that those kind of examples and figure out how in this new partnership with Charter and across the NBC portfolio and we find a way to continue to innovate and be relevant to the next generation and existing generation of television viewers. So I'm -- and then you put in place what Sky is doing with Sky Glass and you see how it can be integrated into without any box right into your television and that's what XClass can be. So I don't know I think it's a pretty exciting road map ahead definitely some change and that's what I think our company has been pretty good at navigating. Jeff?Thank you John. No I don't think there's any new things to report today. I think we're here to really focus on a great quarter and a great start to the year. Obviously the strategy I think Jeff said it well that we employed and goes back a number of years that we just -- we have a company that has a lot of opportunities around the world. And I think we are pretty focused on those opportunities. You're always going to look at new things and changes in the situation just as Jeff also said. But the main focus and you take something like your last point on the Olympics I used the one example on a television show I just can't emphasize even though the Olympics were really challenged and maybe weren't what we all had hoped for when we bought years ago with all the political activity around the world the team the storytelling the heroes athletes this company can do things no other company can do to present that using new technologies. And I think that's what puts us in a very special place. Jeff?,0.003685951,0.005537331,0.0013441

35,35,WFC,Santomassimo:,"Just a reminder I said in my script Steve too on the impact of the reduction in nonsufficient fund balance fees and some of the overdraft changes we made youâ€™ll start to see the impact of that in the second quarter as well.Yes. And as you look at the efficiency and I think hopefully this was implied in what we -- the guidance we gave but weâ€™re executing well on the efficiency program that weâ€™ve got. And as I said a number of times over the last couple of quarters itâ€™s not a -- itâ€™s not a static program like this is something that weâ€™re embedding in the DNA of how we run the place and it continues to evolve and we feel good about executing on that.Yes. And as earnings capacity grows as NII grows and we go through the year we execute on our efficiency program thereâ€™s -- and weâ€™re still operating under the asset cap you -- thereâ€™s -- I think youâ€™ll see us be prudent but weâ€™ve got plenty of flexibility as we look through the rest of the year.Yes. So what we said Ken as you look at the first quarter is about $400 million of expenses fell away in the quarter as the business exited. And the remainder -- and so about $300 million of that was from the ongoing run rate of the businesses about $100 million was a charge we took last year for the student loan business. And the remainder falls either under the TSAs which are in place today and likely run most of the year if not into early next year. But remember thereâ€™s revenue on the other side of that. And then you have the stranded costs. So the numbers we laid out at the end of the fourth quarter last year are -- havenâ€™t changed. And as the TSAs roll off weâ€™ll do our best to highlight that if itâ€™s meaningful. And then weâ€™re going to continue to work on the stranded costs and get them out but that will take a little bit of time as we said last quarter.Yes. And the combo of PPP loans and EPBOs came down sequentially or linked quarter about $178 million and that was the impact on revenue there on NII. And so -- and weâ€™ll reiterate that in the Q when it comes out. As you look at premium am or for mortgage-backed you can look at the slide for reference when you have time. I know itâ€™s a busy day today. But it came down roughly a little over $100 million $110 million $15 million decline in the quarter. And that will continue to decline as prepay slow throughout the year. So itâ€™s come down quite a bit since where we were last year.Yes. As you know predicting investment banking fees and market fees is fraught with lots of issues. But I think look the -- itâ€™s clear that on the investment banking side some of the capital markets particularly on the equity side has slowed quite a bit this year given some of the volatility weâ€™ve seen. Our pipeline really hasnâ€™t change much. Itâ€™s still pretty strong from where we stand coming into the quarter. And so some of that realization of that pipeline is just somewhat market-dependent and dependent on some deals timing of some of the deals closing. So weâ€™ll see. The markets revenue is somewhat dependent on the volatility that we see and the demand we see. And so I think as others have gone through this weâ€™ll benefit from some of that as we go through it. But thatâ€™s hard to predict exactly where weâ€™ll end up. And then on Norwest Venture look if you go back a number of years and you look at thereâ€™s some number -- thereâ€™s some like stability to that line when you look at over the last three or four years. I think when you look at some of what happened this quarter we did have a bunch of realized like business being sold or going public in one or two cases of some of the investments. And so that was really good to see that thatâ€™s still continuing despite some of the market volatility. And I think weâ€™ll see how it goes. I think we wonâ€™t -- itâ€™s hard to imagine weâ€™ll see some of the peaks that we saw last year in that revenue line item. But I do expect weâ€™ll continue to see some good performance across those businesses.Yes. No. So a lot of itâ€™s going to be dependent on how fast the Fed moves. And as you know when the Fed moves the impact of that is immediate you start realizing that the day after. And so obviously those expectations there have changed quite a bit. So that will be the case. I think in the Q we give you the shock numbers on 100 basis-point moves. And those are pretty close to what you should expect for the first few rate rises in terms of the impact. And again itâ€™s pretty immediate for the most of it.Yes. It has to yes. I mean absolutely. It will continue to come down as we see rates go up and prepay slow sorry about that. But yes I think youâ€™ll start to see that come down. Will it -- I think it will be -- itâ€™s a little bit dependent upon again how things progress but itâ€™s not unreasonable to think as we look at the next quarter that itâ€™s somewhere in the ballpark of what we saw from -- on a linked quarter basis this quarter.Yes. Thatâ€™s baked into the increase in NII that we gave John.Yes. Hey Betsy itâ€™s Mike. Iâ€™ll try to take a shot at that. I think on the resi mortgage side what youâ€™re seeing is the impact of the EPBO loans and so theyâ€™re coming -- they impacted us coming down. So that creates a little bit of noise I think there relative to the yield there. If you look at the rest of the -- on the C&I book Iâ€™m going to get the directionally the percentage. But itâ€™s call it two-thirds of the C&I book in that neighborhood is floating rate maybe plus or minus a little bit there but the -- and so that starts to react pretty -- obviously direct pretty quickly to rates moving. And in any given quarter you see a little bit of noise on that yield but youâ€™ll start to see that react as rates go up.No.Well I think we reiterated our expense guidance for the year and NII is going to be a lot better.Yes. Matt Iâ€™ll take that. As weâ€™ve said a few times in the past we plan to run the CET1 ratio at somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points over our reg minimum which right now is 9.1%. And I think as we look forward given the way the framework works is weâ€™ll have plenty of flexibility to do what we think is prudent on buybacks as we go throughout the rest of the year.As a whole think of the mortgage banking income line as what weâ€™re referring to.Well I think as you think about the industry as a whole itâ€™s hard Gerard to look at any specific metrics per se. But I think where youâ€™re going to see that first is likely gain on sale margins as people start to normalize as excess capacity comes out right? So I think thatâ€™s probably one of the areas I would look at.Well we donâ€™t disclose the margin itself as you sort of look forward. But normal varies right as you sort of look through the cycle in the mortgage business. And so I think weâ€™re certainly -- if you start thinking about primary secondary spreads thatâ€™s one indicator of sort of where gain on sale margins will go I think. And weâ€™re now back to what is likely more historical levels right around 100 basis points or so when you look at that. And thatâ€™s -- so I think youâ€™re kind of back to a more normal level there. And then I think as excess capacity goes out like youâ€™ll start to see the gain on sale come back up. So I think itâ€™s hard to say exactly what normal will look like there as we go through the cycle.Itâ€™s just the severity of the variables that went into it Gerard. And obviously itâ€™s a bit of a black box in terms of what -- exactly what the answer is. And so we do our best to try to look at like how that might impact us and how the Fed might look at it. But itâ€™s really based on the severity of the scenario that played through.I appreciate it. And I think thatâ€™s the last question. So we know itâ€™s a really busy day for everyone. So we thank you for spending the time and weâ€™ll talk soon.""",0.00275448,0.002954304,0.000116629
36,36,DHR,Blair:,Well Jack I will tell you we have excelled in these kind of environments historically from an M&A perspective. These environments of dislocation inevitably show opportunity and we feel very good about how we are positioned with our funnel. Now having said that the volatility that we are seeing today is while it might not feel that way relatively recent and itâ€™s probably a little too early to see the full impact of that volatility. Having said that we are sitting here with 2x a turn very strong free cash flow of over $7 billion and over $10 billion of EBITDA. So we feel like we are in a very good position both in terms of the strength of our balance sheet as well as the opportunities that lie ahead.Good morning Patrick.So Western Europe has continued to perform very well for us. As I mentioned in our opening comments here we had strong growth in the mid-teens in Western Europe here in the first quarter. And while we think that moderates a little bit here in Q2 just because of some of the prior year performance is the activity levels remain very strong. Certainly in Western Europe that is the case. And as you think about your reference to the geopolitical side Eastern Europe just has not been that large of a factor in the life science research and bioprocessing area as an example. And from a diagnostics perspective we continue to see a very high letâ€™s say close to normal activity levels as well. So Western Europe for us continues to perform as expected.As we think about the business momentum really in all regions with the exception of China which I talked about we are seeing patient levels activity levels really at or very close to pre-pandemic levels. And so from a macro perspective and patient volume itâ€™s a positive environment for us. And then if you put on the back of that the recent product launches that we have had the DxH900 hematology as well as the DxA Fit and automation for small and medium-sized labs we are also continuing to benefit from that NPI pace that we have invested in here over the past year. So for us diagnostics continues to be a strong forward momentum. Matt do you want to take this?Good morning Luke.Happy to. So Luke the way we are thinking about that is â€“ the strength of our underlying business which I laid out here in some details some clinical trials mAbs biosimilar volumes keep in mind itâ€™s the commercialized drugs that really drive volume here in this business. And then of course that additional growth accelerator of the single-use technology adoption. Those are really the foundations that are driving the growth of this business. And the COVID business it will do what it does but that variation is within the realm of what we have been casting as the overall growth rate of the business. And so you take the backlog which continues to grow quarter-over-quarter and you take the growth drivers that I have laid out. That is what supports the high-single digit low-double digit growth for 2022 and the high-single digit longer term growth guide that we have talked about.Thatâ€™s going to continue to pace out as we add line after line after line. But I would say that these are programs that are coming on on or better than schedule as the team continues to gain speed here not only with their subject matter expertise which is differentiated. So unique in the marketplace but also with their adoption of the Danaher Business System. So we look for that $500 million here in 2022.,0.477649361,0.945579708,0.467930347
37,37,VZ,Ellis:,Yes. And Brett your question on cash flows you â€“ in your question you used to phrase it a timing factor in here and I think absolutely thatâ€™s part of what weâ€™re seeing. So couple of things on the receivable side with the last couple of years we actually had some tailwinds associated with some of the impacts of the lower volumes that came through as we went through the pandemic. And now weâ€™re seeing those volumes return to more normal levels which creates a temporary headwind but itâ€™s really just getting back to where we were. You think about device payment levels those are certainly up year-over-year. As we said activations were up in the quarter 11%. Therefore weâ€™ve more device loans on the balance sheet but itâ€™s really getting back to those pre-pandemic levels rather than anything else. We saw an actual benefit in core customer payments that helped the year ago number with all the subsidy money out there. That was a one-time benefit that weâ€™re lapping. Customer payments continue to be incredibly strong. So weâ€™re very pleased with that. And then the inventory side as weâ€™ve managed through some of the disruptions that weâ€™ve seen there weâ€™ve taken advantage of the balance sheet strength we have to run it higher the normal inventory levels. But obviously I would be looking to have us return to more normal levels on that over time here. So I expect those to be just timing factors as you said in your question and continues to be very competent in the overall strengths of the cash flows that this business produces.Yes. Thereâ€™s certainly a little bit of an increase in it is largely what you see in the inventory side of the balance sheet there coming from handsets and so on. So there is a little bit more cushion in there in the system so to speak which we think is appropriate given the environment that everyoneâ€™s operating in. But itâ€™s certainly something that we have â€“ we think gives us a good position in the marketplace and as supply chains become more predictable again going forward weâ€™ll adjust that accordingly.Yes. Phil so your question around just what weâ€™re seeing there. Look I would tell you that there is nothing that we see in the data that suggests any change in share out there. Certainly believe there has been a bit of a down tick in overall foot traffic not just in our stores but up and down the high street. But our share continues to be where we would expect it to be. Our churn continues to be very strong and thatâ€™s always a good indicator of if we are competing effectively and clearly with the churn at these levels versus historical levels we feel very good about that. So overall continuing to get our fair share and we expect to continue to do so.Yes. So just a couple of things add on there. So Simon as you think about the volumes we had in the first quarter remember thatâ€™s not a full quarter of C-Band. That came on in middle of January. And of course you have that time period where the sales teams are building up the sales motion of selling a new product. So certainly think that we can continue to see good numbers there as we go through the rest of the year. And weâ€™re just getting started with what you saw the 194 000 in the first quarter. And from a pricing standpoint as Hans said itâ€™s â€“ you should think about it that price point you mentioned is for a customer whoâ€™s also taking wireless products from us as well. On a standalone basis itâ€™s higher price but weâ€™ll continue to look at the pricing proposition and maximize both the value for customers but also the opportunity for us as well.If I just had one comment onto Hansâ€™ last piece there while certainly we always want to find a higher gear and never happy with a result I think we can do better next year. The phone ads was 142 000 battery in 1Q this year than last year. So you see us continuing to make progress there.On the guidance Mike so as you think through it in terms of the lower end of range on wireless service revenue. Part of that is obviously as we see the nature of the competitive environment but itâ€™s also the volumes that you see us delivering and some of the impacts of that. So excited by 11% increase in activations year-over-year that shows strong interest from our customers but that of course does mean that we see the amortization impact from promo come through the wireless service revenue and so weâ€™ll see that impact there. That of course will also impact the EBITDA guidance but EBITDA guidance also has our views on inflation as well as we think about the year as a whole and certainly those views have evolved over the has 90 days for everyone as well. And then so obviously EBITDA impacts the EPS guidance and the EPS also has the interest expense that I commented on in my prepared remarks that itâ€™s probably the low-single digit impact on an EPS basis that obviously come through as a result of higher Fed hikes and was probably in peopleâ€™s plans at the start of the year. So a number of factors impact in each of those items. We still feel very confident in the results of the business weâ€™ll produce this year and the momentum that weâ€™re building in the year across the growth vectors to deliver the long-term aspirations that we all have.Yes. Thanks Craig. So as you think about it so when you look at the P times Q that you mentioned we got ARPU up to 2.6% on the postpaid side. So certainly see a continuation of executing on the strategy. Weâ€™ve talked about of stepping customers up getting more customers on premium plans. The team continues to do a good job there and you see that in the a side. You also see as we mentioned an increase in the number of accounts on wireless year-over-year 40 000 more accounts this year than this time a year ago. So the P times Q there works but this comes back to what we talked about at the Investor Day having five vectors of growth and really what we talked about there is just one of them. In addition to that obviously weâ€™ve got fixed wireless access kicking in now 194 000 net ads in the first quarter over 400 000 in the base thatâ€™s exactly in line with what we said you should see with increasing the base this year and therefore that having a more meaningful impact on revenue in 2023 but weâ€™re building that base now in line with what we said. And then you laid out the things like MEC and obviously on that not just within the B2B space mobile edge compute but also as we get into the 5G world. The scope of opportunity for IoT a machine to machine continues to increase and we talked about the momentum we have there and thatâ€™s just really getting started. On the prepaid side we continue to see that the integration of TracFone going as expected and we expect that to add value as we go forward here and then we continue to see growth in our network monetization vector too. So we still feel very confident that we have the ability to grow across more vectors than other people that starts with mobility and extends into the other one but absolutely think youâ€™ll see growth across all of those. Hans?Yes. So Doug just add onto that a little bit. If you think about network usage and customers demand on the network continues to grow year-over-year thatâ€™s true across every geography. So you should expect no difference in how we think out C-Band rollout to get 5G Ultra Wideband to all of our customers the same way we did with LTE rollout a decade ago. And as you saw with the LTE rollout as we got out of the initial launch areas to more nationwide we did that within our overall CapEx envelope and thatâ€™s what weâ€™ve described that you should expect from us as we do the same thing with C-Band and get the 5G experience to all of our customers as soon as possible here.Yes. So on the comments about March and April volumes those are predominantly on the consumer side nothing particular in terms of breaking the consumer apart there in terms of particular areas. But as Hans said the VBG site Verizon Business Group continues to do very strong performance across small business enterprise public sector double-digit growth and gross ads across each of those parts of Tamiâ€™s business in the first quarter. And that really fairly even throughout the quarter. So we saw a little lower foot traffic on the consumer side but the business side continues to perform at a fairly even level throughout the quarter and as we head into Q2 here.,0.002869785,0.003130257,0.000175093
38,38,NEE,Ketchum:,Thank you.Yes Steve let me go ahead and take that. This is John speaking. That's one of the things that we're pointing out to the Commerce Department is that when they established tariffs say they come up with a final determination of January of 2023 their practice has always been to impose the tariffs and calculate the actual amounts and release those two years later. So those tariffs would not be known until the first quarter of 2025. And so what the industry would be forced to do perversely is actually go back and buy panels from China because the tariffs in China are known. And China is the only country in the world that would have panels available to sell because as we said in our remarks the U.S. panel manufacturing industry which is incredibly small again even at full capacity it only has the ability to satisfy 10% to 20% of the entire U.S. demand. The U.S. industry is sold out until 2025. And if you don't know what the tariff rates are in Southeast Asia it forces you back to China where the tariffs are known and have been known for the last 10 years which is an absolutely perverse outcome an outrageous outcome quite frankly and one we intend to make sure that the Commerce Department clearly understands because that's an unintended consequence that I don't think anybody wants. And the other point that goes along with it is if we're trying to be tough on trade we're not. China is not the one that pays the price. Who pays the price here are American companies American workers the American consumer that pays higher electricity costs than they ever have before in a rapidly increasing natural gas price environment oil prices coal prices. Solar is actually deflationary. And you actually reward the Chinese who then get to sell panels at the inflated rate. So that makes absolutely no sense at all. When you look at our company and our business we are in I think a different position than the rest of the industry is. While all those things are not good for the industry I think our company is in a position to be able to manage these risks fortunately. We have strong contracts in place. We do have a global supply chain and sourcing capability that gives us options that others don't. But back to the strength of our contracts I think that that gives us the ability that others might not have to continue sourcing from our existing supply base even in South Korea without â€“ or I mean in Southeast Asia without those tariff amounts being fully known. But the problem that this creates with that two year delay into 2025 if build back better doesn't get passed or some form of reconciliation you're also on the ITC clock that is expiring over that same period of time. So you have to have an ability to go source those panels find them someplace else to get your projects built. Again we're confident in our ability to be able to do that just given the strength of our contracts that's why â€“ and we're also optimistic that the outcome here is so outrageous and so ludicrous that the Commerce Department won't possibly based on their four prior rulings over the last decade 2012 2014 2020 and in 2021 where this exact question has been asked and answered by three separate administrations including this one how can you possibly pull the rug out from under the industry makes absolutely no sense to force business back to China which is what you were trying to prevent in the first place.Yes. Let me take those in order. So first of all why did they take the investigation? You saw what happened in October. They had a similar filing that was made around circumvention the same Department of Commerce decided not to take that up in the same year that the rule that making cells and panels outside of China was okay. Here in 2022 I think they looked at it and said okay well this is the second one in a row. Let's take on the investigation. We don't think the investigation itself if we just do a little bit more fact-finding will actually have an impact on the industry. They were wrong. It does. We told them it would. And you can see it in our own portfolio at 2.1 to 2.8 gigawatts potentially being moved into 2023. Luckily we have enough cushion and enough other things that we can do or doesn't impact our financial expectations that movement. Other companies in the industry are not that fortunate. And so our hope is that they look at the information. We don't think the information has changed. And they rely on the prior four decisions from 2012 2014 2020 and 2021 to follow a consistent trade practice rather than retroactively changing the rules for an industry that has been playing by the rules for the last decade that would make absolutely no sense in an environment where you have inflation increasing commodity prices and the only deflationary product and source of generation that also achieves clean energy goals and creates a ton of American jobs. Youâ€™re stymieing rather than helping. So thatâ€™s the rationale. The second question I think you had was on where are we on BBB? So look if youâ€™re really looking at â€“ if you look at BBA â€“ BBB in the current environment now is the time to move forward on it like no other. Given the inflationary pressures on energy prices now is the time to double down on renewables. Now is the time to create real manufacturing incentives if you want to re-domesticate the supply chain to the U.S. which is really really small right now. And if you want to create those manufacturing incentives do it with a carrot rather than a stick. So we can achieve our clean energy goals over time. So that gives us some optimism number one going in. Second I think thereâ€™s motivation going into the midterms to get our energy policy right particularly our clean energy policy right. And I think the Democrats do need a win going into these midterms the structure is much the same. So there wouldnâ€™t â€“ weâ€™re not contemplating a large chain of structure both sides are talking. I think for the first time in a while we have the Supreme Court nomination behind us. Time is something we got to work with the reconciliation for this year expires at the end of September. So weâ€™ve really got to try to get something moving forward before the August resource or recess but remain optimistic that we will be able to get that moving forward. And if it does a much skinnier down package that I would expect to look like a focus really just on climate and clean energy and prescription drugs. And that would be I think a smaller package that that might be able to move forward. But I think at the same time thereâ€™s going to have to be some open mindedness from the progresses which I think we are seeing Senator Manchin made no secret that we need pipeline infrastructure in this country projects like MVP for example in more of an all of the above approach to tackling this issue. And I think there is a rational outcome there that would make sense for all parties involved. And then I think your last question was if we have to wait until 2025 whatâ€™s the impact on our long-term expectations. Again we have strong contracts we have a global supply chain capability we would not based on what we know today expect any changes to our long-term financial expectations.Good morning Julian.Julien thank you for the question. In terms of the way weâ€™re thinking about being able to manage this and continue to still have the confidence to reaffirm our adjusted earnings expectations and reiterate that we would be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at near the high end of the range. Look we are a very large company with a diverse set of growth drivers. FPL is performing really well. We have great visibility into the next four years with the settlement agreement. We run the business with a lot of financial discipline and build a conservative financial plan. We â€“ as we discussed today continue to find ways to run the business more efficiently and have identified through the project velocity over $400 million of run rate savings that we expect to be able to receive over the next few years. When we add all that up and particularly think about how conservatively we are with the way we structure our plan. We feel very comfortable and being able to continue to deliver on our financial expectations. Yes. And then Julian Iâ€™ll take the last piece on the â€“ I think what I understood your question to be on the supply chain. So thatâ€™s the other reason why we donâ€™t think any action is required by the department of commerce today because the supply chain is already changing for the entire industry. Polysilicon is now being sourced out to Germany. Itâ€™s being sourced out to the United States. Suppliers are quickly becoming more vertically integrated and moving their ingot and wafer producing capabilities outside of China where cells and modules are already made. And that will be a sourcing strategy that will be followed by us and much of the industry going forward including I think by the U.S. the so-called U.S. panel manufacturers one â€“ because one thing I want to make sure people understand. As I said before at full capacity the U.S. panel manufacturers can satisfy only 10% to 20% of U.S. demand but when they make panels in the U.S. theyâ€™re not really making panels in the U.S. Theyâ€™re importing all of the products that go into a panel from outside the U.S. mainly from the Southeast Asian countries. And they have these small assembly shops in the U.S. that employ a few hundred people that go ahead and just put it together. And then they stamp the panel made in the USA when it really isnâ€™t. And thatâ€™s one of the frustrating things that weâ€™re tackling here but we are â€“ again as I said moving the supply chain outside of China and the U.S. panel manufacturers I assume will be looking at some more things for their continued reliance on imports as they think about their strategy going forward as well.Yes. So on the first piece of your question cost savings is one piece of it. We have cushion in our plan. We run the business very conservatively. We have cushion in the plan. We expect to be okay. Kirk Iâ€™ll let you take the FPL question.Sure. Shar Iâ€™ll take that. So the first point that I would make is that this is good for the wind business. I think you could see that from the results of our origination activity this quarter. So even to the extent we might see some shifting solar from 2022 to 2023 or 2023 to 2024 wind is coming online even faster. And remember the development cycle for wind and the origination activity for wind is much shorter. We can originate a wind project and have it built in 10 months. And so to the extent you might see some solar activity drop off â€“ and really again I view this as a 2022 and 2023 issue. The beauty of it is you have wind to step in and gets placed. And thatâ€™s an area where we have significant competitive advantages. And being able to sell 23 wind at a 80% PTC we can be extremely competitive in the pricing there and in the offering. And it provides us with I think a mitigation measure on top of the strong supplier contracts that we already have on the solar side that others in the industry donâ€™t have. Itâ€™s great to have a diversified business to be able to fall back on and thatâ€™s why we feel good about our financial expectations.Yes. I think first of all I want to say the CapEx is actually up at FPL just back to â€“ I think it was Julienâ€™s earlier question. Undergrounding is a piece of that. Itâ€™s really important we get our undergrounding in service on time and on budget. We continue to look to ways to shift that to the left. And look as we are in an increasing natural gas price environment the right answer for Florida customers certainly is to evaluate and look at trying to get more renewables online in Florida faster. Itâ€™s a hedge against rising natural gas prices in the state. And itâ€™s a hedge for the country which is another reason why as Iâ€™ve said a couple of times already whatâ€™s happening is quite silly.Yes. Let me just give a little bit of background there. We were asked a while back to provide some documentation in connection with that matter which we did. We cooperated in full. We were told and have been told we are not a target of the investigation. And I think the article you're referring to the reporter just got it flat out wrong. We have not been subpoenaed as a witness in that matter.Thank you.,0.155566156,0.919413388,0.341602937
39,39,PM,Olczak:,Good morning.Thatâ€™s correct. Weâ€™re just talking for the entire year the volumes from Russia and Ukraine. But then obviously for the Q1 we recognize what have been sold in both geographies which is 5 billion. Therefore on a pro forma for the full year excluding Russia and Ukraine looking into 88 billion to 92 billion. But if you add back the 5 billion which we already sold during the first period the first quarter that directly translates to 93 billion-97 billion which would assume or is assuming that there is no further sales of IQOS as of April 1 in neither Russia nor Ukraine.Yes. Okay. So the first quarter shipments of the devices on the one hand yes youâ€™re absolutely right it contributes to the better help to the global revenue but remember that the devices are putting a pressure on the margins right. So thatâ€™s started between the devices and the impact on the one hand on the revenue and the margins. The big impact which we expect to have in Q2 is on the supply of the shipments of the consumables. So the heat sticks and TEREA. And as a result among other constraints on the supply chain of stopping the investment in Russia we need to resource that missing capacity to our locations and it will take us a while. And therefore we expect that we will go lower with the inventories in Japan mainly Japan in order to ensure that on the manufacturing side the proper resourcing we will have when we expect quite a robust growth on IMS and the market share. And I think Emmanuel on the slide have indicated that we should think weâ€™re aiming at 24% â€“ around 24% market share for the quarter in Japan. So itâ€™s nothing on the consumer level on the offtake level but we need to do this operations through the inventories in order to resume to the normal course of shipments in the Q3 and Q4. And hence this will drive the better performance and stronger performance in the second half than the first half which will be what we estimate to be impacted by the Q2 difference in the shipments. Now with regards to the devices I mean there is this continuous sale of the devices in the excluded geographies right. So itâ€™s not that we stopped selling we stopped recognizing this whole thing due to the visibility and the other factors what is happening in Russia and Ukraine. But in reality we need to keep at least the replacement devices right. So itâ€™s not that you can take the volume out of Russia and Ukraine and to redirect them to other locations. We do have actually getting better and better but not perfect visibility with regards to the device supplies. And remember weâ€™ve been very cautious about second half of last year. And the moment when we had the better order fulfillment and also better visibility with regards to the future orders for this year we feel more confident about how we can realize the â€“ fully realize the opportunity of IQOS. So that looks okay itâ€™s not perfect but I donâ€™t want to misled anybody itâ€™s not perfect but itâ€™s better than say at the beginning of the year. And you saw it at the moment that we have regained some have almost full-fledged availability of devices how IQOS could accelerate its growth for the user acquisition and the market share progression in Q1. So we know that we have it but everything hinges on a continually and undisturbed uninterrupted supplies of the both devices and heat sticks.Good morning.Well â€“ thank you. We continue with the geographical and portfolio expansion of IQOS in the existing and the new geographies and obviously this we confronted with all the supply chain constraints and availability of devices et cetera. So I mean we all know this. The good way or one of the way maybe to look at that 2023 target so I believe youâ€™re referring to the absolute volume target for IQOS is that okay letâ€™s assume that we donâ€™t have and the lowest assumptions you can make is that we will not realize any further sales as of April 1 in Russia and Ukraine and thatâ€™s essentially the floor on that thing. Where do we land? I think everyone will appreciate we need a little bit of a time to really have the full visibility whatâ€™s happening or what we will do with our business and our intentions about exiting Russia and also whatâ€™s the â€“ whatever might be the longer term outlook for our Ukrainian et cetera. There will be a band in absolute numbers. Itâ€™s no questions about it. The way I look into this whole thing we may be in a situation that weâ€™ll deliver this target but with about a 12 months delay. I mean I am not in a position â€“ my thinking is not changed the target just recognized that you maybe need a little bit of additional time to deliver on this target. All other parameters the relative growth targets being the top-line bottom-line and the relative growth of the â€“ or relative contribution which is very important target for us of the non-combustible to combustible business they remain as we have said before. And on that one Iâ€™m confident we should be in a position to deliver this. But in absolute volume yes I mean we might have a miss. But the way again sorry for repetition I look at this maybe I need a 12 months more to deliver the same target for other geographies and organic growth in existing geographies.Yes I think your question was sorry because we all cut half the sentence. Your question was can we expect the same dynamics of the user acquisition right going forward?Okay. So look I mean above 1 million acquisition this quarter which show the growth sequentially above close to 1 million acquisition the Q4. I mean that directly correlated to our availability of devices and a full portfolio of devices. As you know we also play now the different price segments game we have more expensive devices mid-price devices lower-price devices. So as long as we have availability of devices I actually think that number we should repeat the same sort of the rate if not actually higher because you could see from the conversion perspective and the consumer liking measured by NPS and other parameters what weâ€™re offering today that is meeting the consumer expectations. So thereâ€™s also bridging somehow to the before questions that once we see the visibility on the devices right in the next quarter or so and all the dynamics which we can achieve outside the Russia and Ukraine then we would be in a positions to revise what actually we will deliver in a year from now in terms of the total IQOS volume.Hi good morning Vivien.I think that the device mix weâ€™re talking that weâ€™re selling three â€“ as of now three versions of IQOS ILUMA you have a premium mid and the lower price lower price was just introduced now to the market to the consumers. So obviously in the shipments we already had them in the Q1 because this is all recognized on the shipment. And second is that this device I mean the ILUMA ONE which is the lowest price device goes at attractive price in the market higher than the competitions but attractive and lower than the price that we used to have on the one version of IQOS 3 before. So maybe here to Vivien we need to look into.No this again comes so we had post price increase post price change environment in Germany the one thing. And second is again I mean the Germany start benefiting from not the restricted access to the devices. So this again follows the same story that we have a continuous broad range availability of the devices. We can go into the portfolio again and hence the performance. And this is one additional comment I would make here Vivien is that Germany is still running on the IQOS free one version which is a blade version and the reasons why we went for example to Switzerland with IQOS ILUMA before opening the larger market which obviously will take a lot of volume of the device is how IQOS ILUMA would to performing in the similar sort of a geography. So I am very pleased with the success so far of IQOS ILUMA in Switzerland especially the German speaking part because I used this as a â€“ we could use this as the proxy for German on acceleration of the â€“ further acceleration of the growth in Germany. Now nothing is certain in life. But I think this is as far as we can read through the consumer reactions in Switzerland.Bonnie Jacek here. Judging just by the number of details you mentioned in that question you will appreciate how complex the situation is in Russia. So one by one. Russia in terms of the so far production and export allocation was not really that significant. We had a much more significant plans of expanding Russia is that one of the key suppliers of new IQOS ILUMA and hence our decision to immediately stop that investment as a result of that we created a temporary halt for the rest of the market. Partially for Russia launch of ILUMA which we also canceled but also that Russia was supposed to contribute to the supply of the ILUMA consumables that are HeatSticks into other markets including in Japan. So our first priority is how we can resource that capacity there. Obviously that capacity means that we have an equipment installed in Russia. And we canâ€™t â€“ so we donâ€™t use this equipment today. What will happen to that equipment going forward? We are also working on a certain plans but I would stop here I will not go into more details. Now to exit Russia in the orderly manner for us that we need to reconcile the interest first of all of our shareholders the employees in Russia. And you know that the ever-evolving legislation in Russia puts the significant risk or constraints of our ability to adhere. And this is only in the context of the very evolving regulatory environment both on the international itâ€™s obviously the sanctions but also the legislations or legislation in Russia. So if we want to we have a significant presence in Russia as we all know it. Weâ€™re in the market organically built the business over the last 30 years. This is 100% business of PMI International. We donâ€™t have any partners contributing to the core business. We obviously are connected with the local supply chains and wholesale and distribution components. But PM Izhora and Philip Morris sales and distribution is 100% Philip Morris business. We have some shareholding in addition to this we have a key distributor in the market together along with our major tobacco company. And to unwind in orderly manner all the strengths which we have in Russia is a complex endeavor but we are committed to do so. Hence in our guidance and the decisions to look at the PMI as the rest of the business which is doing absolutely great despite all of the headwinds which we have and so on rather than have polluted with something which we have limited visibility and ability to act accordingly. So I know that my answer have not gave you more clarity but that is the best which we can say at this moment. I mean weâ€™re working on exit but presumably one of the most complicated transactions in the terms of the history of the group which weâ€™re drawing from the board.Well we rather not delay beyond what is necessary as long as we satisfy all the teams or the groups if you like. And again I repeat it I mean our â€“ we have a responsibility to shareholders. But we also have responsibility to employees in Russia. And overall broad group of stakeholders with the various expectations and try to resolve that equation to the satisfaction of everyone thatâ€™s becoming complex exercise. But we are working relentlessly of how to move forward. I mean I would appreciate that if this was any other size of the business and presence in the market things could have looked differently. But this was a very big business for us.Yes. Thank you. So obviously we need to make some or making some assumptions on the supply chain as I said earlier. We donâ€™t live today in a perfect visibility for all the remaining quarters of this year. But I think we have enough of the confidence to come up with this pro forma estimate or this pro forma guidance. Now look you see that continuous trajectory of IQOS growth in essentially in all geographies including the geographies that historically were a bit tougher for us where yet we had the progress but they were not really growing at the group level of the growth and now we see that Japan with that ILUMA and a few other locations with ILUMA already having a massive acceleration of the growth. We know what we have in our plans for this thereafter with ILUMA. We also know that IQOS [indiscernible] which is the currently the mostly sold device also continues to be very attractive. And this is continuously despite the fact that we offering our portfolio both of the devices and the consummables at a significant premium to any other market propositions. I think weâ€™re getting this confidence that IQOS continue to grow and weâ€™re looking forward also to the moment when it will accelerate its growth. Will IQOS in a near term excluding Russia and Ukraine sorry the rest of the geographies compensate the lack of Russia and Ukraine? I think over a longer period of time we once notice but in shorter period of time it might a bit challenging okay. Weâ€™re not making any promises at this stage.Thank you.Well I think we should â€“ I mean we have the information of Q1 that are pointing to this evolution. It is true Gaurav that there are no uncertainty on whatâ€™s going to be the growth of the global economy in the coming quarters. I suppose there is some trend in the market that our underlying trends in term of demographics and behaviors. Letâ€™s face it there is also still the contribution of rebound after the COVID. So last year was not a normal year we are becoming much more normal. Iâ€™m not saying weâ€™re there yet. I mean in Duty Free weâ€™re not. But in other markets we can hope that for the coming months to be more normal and thatâ€™s going to be a positive. So I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to be the impact of a potential slowdown of the economy. By the way weâ€™re going to have an impact on volume or more on downtrading and some countries in consumer going for cheaper offering. Today what we see and weâ€™ve been highlighting that is Marlboro recovering market share and we see Chesterfield being very successful and we see of course great success with all our IQOS brands. So that is what is driving for us this outlook for growth in volume. And of course starting Q1 with a very nice growth even if we flag the fact that there were some â€“ maybe some anticipation but I think that the Q1 numbers are there. It shows the dynamism that we are seeing in our portfolio.Well Gaurav so yes of course on the basis of the guidance that weâ€™ve been giving we would have a payout ratio that would significantly increase versus 2021. I think weâ€™ve shown in the past the capacity to grow in profit over time and reduce that. Our objective to go down over time and we didnâ€™t give any kind of precise to go down to 75% is still there. I agree that given the adverse event that we are facing itâ€™s going to take a bit more time to get there. Thatâ€™s the case not so much I mean the currency is playing but itâ€™s really the accumulation of currency and Russia leaving the perimeter of the group that is driving that situation. Now on the ForEx thereâ€™s two elements. One is the pressure on margin and we continue to work on trying to equalize better the currency in which weâ€™re investing and the currency in which we have our cost. We do that with the supply chain. There are some limitation because there are a number of things that you buy in dollar of course we do that through everything we buy. But there is one element that we kind change that we have limited invoicing in dollar. So when the dollar is going up versus most of the currency that is an impact which is mechanical and on which there is not much we can do. So we can work and I think we continue to work on the margin dimension. We cannot work on the fact that we have limited invoicing.Thank you.Weâ€™re taking a price increase and a price variance. So the opening of the â€“ came in be better than we initially thought. We will see what the remaining part of the year and especially the second half will bring. When we look at the inflation I mean we also have to look of what is the inflation of the material. So like the cost of living and what is the inflation of the income right? Because we havenâ€™t yet seen the inflation on the income level at the concept level. So we have to find the right spot at the right balance where do we get into this. But in most of the geographies I mean the pricing environment I would characterize it is getting positive. I mean Emmanuel talk about the Indonesia. On the other hand we have a very strong rebound in volumes in Indonesia. And hopefully also Indonesia which used to be quite important a significant contributor to the pricing will hopefully towards the end of this year or definitely 2023 will resume this pricing contribution. We had a price increase in Germany flowing through the market the Philippines Turkey okay. Now Turkey goes to the hyper-inflationary accounting. Weâ€™re trying to price it widely looking at the inflation as the pressure. But as I said at the beginning of the year we already started with the ahead of our own expectations pricing variance. So letâ€™s see how that this will continue through the year.Well there is this continuous â€“ remember this is the part of the world which is still not out of the woods with regards to COVID unfortunately right? So the situation is not really didnâ€™t get back to the pre-COVID side. I believe there is some underlying growth opportunities just by the fact that if they continue to recover from the COVID situation we should start seeing the continuously better volume. And as I said I mean we took the price increase in Philippines weâ€™re taking some pricing in weâ€™re taking the pricing a little bit accelerated in Indonesia but on the other hand we are still in the â€“ as you remember Indonesia take a couple of around steps of a price increase to pass on the beginning of the excise increase. So we still need a bit of time to go into the net margin improvement territory. But itâ€™s very much hinges essentially to keep it short on continuous recovery and no further surprises with regards of the COVID situation.Okay so thank you everyone for your attention and the patients and the quarter was pretty complex and complicated for us and since due to some technical problems the earnings call also canâ€™t somehow adjusted to the situations in the quarter. I have one on the comment toward everyone I hope is still on the line. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Nick Rolli outstanding contribution to PMI and our former parent company over the past 35 years and particularly as the Vice President Investor Relations since the 2008 Philip Morris International. As you all believe will agree with me he has been a critical contributor through the journey of our company. And I know that you our investors and analysts will join me in congratulating Nick and to wish him all the best for his very well deserved retirement. At the same time I would also like to congratulate James Bushnell on his new role I have a pleasure because I personally was hiring Mr. Bushnell to PMI in his new role as the successor to Nick Rolli and I believe he would receive the same support and we welcome as Nick Rolli enjoy from you for the last 35 years. So welcome James and thank you Nick.See you soon guys. Thank you.,0.002688593,0.003148735,0.000184527
40,40,RTX,Hayes:,Yes Sheila just a comment on portfolio rationalization. We obviously haven't been sitting still for the last two years. We've been looking at across the portfolio. But to your point we were really kind of hamstrung because of the spin transactions and the merger to not really do anything significant with any of our portfolio during that two year period. So we are actively looking across the portfolio today for both acquisitions as well as divestitures. I would tell you the acquisitions will probably be technology-related and smaller dollar similar to what we did last year with Seeker Engineering or Blue Canyon in the space side. And then we are going to look at the Collins portfolio for potential divestitures. There are certain businesses that do not have the growth profile the margin profile or the technical footprint that we're looking for in some of these product lines. So I would expect over the next six to nine months we'll complete those analysis. Obviously you don't want to be selling any of these businesses in a down aero market but with the recovery that we're expecting this year and next I would think we will probably be doing something later this year or early next year.Thanks Sheila.Good morning David.That's a great question for the Boeing company tomorrow when they release earnings. I would tell you we're in lockstep with Boeing in terms of the production schedule on MAX for this year. I know they have talked about 31 a month and we're clearly able to support that level and even higher as we go into next year 787 production I think again it's -- we have been working with Boeing as they're working through their own issues relative to FAA certification to get the aircraft delivered. Obviously there's -- we haven't been shipping a lot down to Charleston on the 787 over the last quarter because of some of those issues. But we would expect as the year progresses we'll start to see that pick up. And I would tell you that Boeing has been very transparent with us in terms of sharing what their delivery and the production forecasts are and it's all reflected in the guidance that we've given for Collins. So no change to any of that today.Good morning.So those are primarily titanium castings from a -- from our supplier that's impacting it. These are structural castings which means you can't really build -- start building most of the engine until you get the castings in and that's what's the holdup is there. I'm sorry was there another part to that question Kristine?There are I think the good news is as you think about inflation in the supply chain is about 80% of the -- our commercial aerospace supply is on long-term agreements. Obviously there's -- some of that comes up for renegotiation every year and we're seeing some cost pressure. Typically every year we see maybe $150 million or so of inflation. I would tell you there's probably an extra $200 million this year of inflation that we're going to have to offset through cost reduction or negotiations with some of the supply chain. In terms of passing it on to the customers typically we have dead band pricing within the contracts which require us to absorb the first tranche of inflation and beyond that we can pass on a portion of it. Unfortunately we're not going to be able to do that this year. That will be a benefit next year as we can increase pricing. We did of course increase pricing on the aftermarket through our catalog that was issued I think last October. That was roughly a 6% increase year-over-year. So we're able to offset a chunk of the -- of that inflation through pricing and the rest is going to have to be offset through either cost reduction redesign or renegotiation.Yes Doug as we think about this given the President's budget request for '23 of $773 billion did not anticipate the Russian invasion of Ukraine. So we were seeing an increase in defense spending before any of this nonsense in Ukraine with the Russians. So I think again the trajectory is better than what we had expected. I mean I will go back two years when the merger first occurred we thought defense spending was going to be flat to up slightly. And I think everybody recognizes the need for modernization and the need to prepare for -- to deter these folks in a more robust fashion. So clearly there's going to be upward pressure on sales guidance but again you probably won't see any of that until '23 or '24. But as we understand what the implications are of the new defense budget what we see in terms of the plus-ups as they go through the process on the '23 NDAA I think again we'll have an opportunity to update everybody later this year on our thinking around kind of that three to five year outlook for defense.Yes absolutely. If you look at just the research and development in the budget that's up 11% versus what was in the '22 budget. So clearly there is going to be more spending than what we had anticipated and importantly it's in those programs like space and some of the other advanced missions that we have an outsized share of.Good morning Noah.Good morning.Thank you Ken.Yes. Ken that's kind of an understatement about China. Obviously I think China accounts for about 16% of global RPMs. A big chunk of that is their domestic market which is down more than 80% because of the lockdowns that we've seen because of COVID. Obviously there is an impact to the aftermarket but we do expect that that will recover. And we have seen that several times in the past where the Chinese lockdown their cities. They get passed away within 30 or 60 days and the traffic comes right back. So we don't expect any long-term impacts from this. I would tell you the aftermarket recovery for wide-body international travels we're still expecting that to recover to roughly 75% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year. China accounts for a piece of that but a relatively small piece of the international long haul really what you're going to need to see is traffic picking up to Japan and Australia and Transatlantic throughout the course of the year which we fully expect. I mean the bookings look very very solid and I think while it looks aggressive in terms of that kind of 75% kind of recovery all indications are that that's exactly what's going to happen.Seth I would tell you it is evolving. As we look at the backlog that Airbus has if you want a slot to take an A320 delivery you're talking about 2028 at current production rates. So there is pressure to move up to that 70 to 75. We're currently facilitized for rate 63 which is something we had agreed to with Airbus well before the pandemic. So I think again there is pressure to take the rate up to 70 or 75 and I think Boeing will see its share will continue to also increase production on the 737 but there is robust demand out there for narrow-body aircraft. And I think again the constraint will be supply chain at the end of the day can not just Pratt and Collins but the entire supply chain support a rate of 75 a month in Talos and Hamburg and then 40 or 50 a month for narrow-body at Boeing the 737. So we'll see. All I would tell you is we remain in lockstep in terms of what's going on over the next 18 to 24 months with both Boeing and Airbus on the narrow-body and we're certainly able to meet those demands today and we'll work with them. If the demand is there we will find a way to meet it.Yes Cai thanks for the question. So obviously we saw inflation building and that price increase was a little bit stronger than what we would typically push for the catalog. I thought usually 4.5% or 5%. So we took the opportunity to raise prices. We do it obviously with keeping in mind in terms of where the demand signals are coming from the customer. And a big chunk of the aftermarket at both Pratt and Collins is on long-term agreements where you don't see that type of 6% increase. But on the time and material overhaul and repair work that we do that we will see the benefit. Obviously inflation is much worse than what we expected it to be for the year. We were thinking 3% to 4% not 8.5% like we saw last month but our hope here is that inflation will moderate as we get to the end of the year. And come October we'll take another look at the catalog and if inflation is still there we will have to address it through the catalog again.Thanks Cai. All right. I think -- go ahead Ludie.All right. Thanks Ludie. Thanks all for listening today. As always Jennifer and the IR team are available all day answer any and all questions you might have. Thank you. Stay healthy and we'll see you all soon. Take care. Bye.,0.002924591,0.003016889,8.25E-05
41,41,BMY,Power:,Let's go the next question Sergei.Thanks. Can we go to the next one please Sergei?Thank you Andrew. Let me ask Samit to answer both of your questions.Sergei can we go to the next one?Thank you Steve. Let me answer the second question and then I'll ask David to answer your question on Revlimid. There is no change the time lines for Milvexian. So the study is on track and we look forward to updating you as soon as the data is in-house David?David. Sergei can we go to the next question please?Let me just answer the first -- the second question on M&A and then Chris will answer your question on deucrava. So -- and let me just reiterate that our focus on M&A has always been there. It's the central pillar of our capital allocation strategy. It's a very important part of our innovation strategy. We've actually had a number of deals that we've executed in the last few months which really confirms a very proactive approach to business development and more broadly. And as a result of that that will continue to guide us in the future. With respect to your question about whether we are seeing any change our experience is that whenever there is some type of realignment in market values it always takes a little bit of time for those values to really -- values the boards of bioter companies look at in terms of their valuation. Having said that of course of course values were extremely high they're somewhat realigned. And then I'll conclude by saying that every company is a bit of a different story and you have to really look at one at a time. But we are confident in the ability to continue to bring innovation into the Company through a combination of business development strategies that go from partnership and collaboration in licensing and potential acquisitions. Chris?Sergei can we go to the next one?Sergei can we go to the next one please?Chris?Okay. Can we go to the next one please?Thank you Dave. Let me ask Samit to answer both of your questions.Sergei can we go to the next one? Can we go the next question please? Sergei can you hear us? Not sure if you can hear us. Sergei we're here if you can.Yes please.We're out of time at this point. Maybe we should wrap up the call Giovanni.,0.002362847,0.002362847,0
42,42,INTC,Gelsinger,: So I'll start and then I'll ask Dave to jump in. So overall as we said our 5 nodes in 4 years we're performing well. Intel 7 is ramping more rapidly than we would have expected. Intel 4 we updated that we have Meteor Lake now powered on which is our first product on Intel 4. Intel 3 we'll see the test wafers on that with our leadership products with Sierra Forest. In fact just today we taped out our first Granite Rapids compute die as well. We'll have the test wafers on 20a and 18a which we expect to be a big foundry node as well. So I'll say overall the technology pipeline is doing tremendously well and really proud of our teams there. Intel 10 it's ramping very well. We're seeing good yields on that as Dave reflected which overall gives us good momentum. In terms of products Alder Lake has been a star and it's ramping comfortably ahead of our expectations there which has reaffirmed the health of Intel 7. Sapphire Rapids that you called out it was first peer PRQs this quarter and many of the additional SKUs PRQ in Q2 -- in the second half of the year and that's why you might be getting some of that views of the more muted ramp there. But we delivered on exactly what we said. First quarter PRQs of Sapphire Rapids and we'll see strength in that as we go through the rest of the year. Also Ice Lake has ramped very nicely now for our 10-nanometer server part. So overall the technology and the manufacturing machine are performing quite well and really bode well for our outlook for this year and the years to come. So Dave if you might add?: Yes. And I'll just say overall the product line is healthy. We're seeing the mix shifts as you move to Alder Lake Raptor Lake being very strong Ice lake as well. We'll start to see Sapphire Rapids factor into that in the second half of the year. So overall we're coming into a stronger product cycle Joe right which just gives us more opportunity to right to deliver higher value to customers remix the products to higher price points. But overall just have a more competitive product line as we go compete for market share as well.: Yes. Thank you Harlan. And overall AXG is on track. And we launched the mobile SKUs. We'll have the desktop SKUs coming in Q2. And we'll have more SKUs as we go through the year as well. We'll be filling out the product line. A lot of work right in qualifying games. And if you're a gamer you know that there's just a lot of individual optimization work on some of the key titles so that work is underway working with our OEMs to populate their portfolios of products as well. So I'll say you're going to see more and more of that hitting the market and we'll be filling out -- we have the 3 versions. We'll have the 5 7 and 9 versions of the year products coming out as we go build up that portfolio this year. And also as I alluded to AXG just has a boatload of products that is coming out across different segments our high-performance computing products our GPU products for data center our blockchain of products. So in addition to the discrete graphics products we have just a lot of products coming out of it. So overall it's on track for the volume goals as well as for hitting the $1 billion revenue goal that we said at Investor Day as we go build as we said over the 5-year horizon to a $10-plus billion business. We see this as a great opportunity for us. And we have some unfair advantages with technologies like Deep Link where we really get to build on the strong robust installed base that we have the many years of software work that we've built into the foundations of the PC platform. So these are reasons that we do think that we have a great opportunity to build a major new business for us and one that's -- we're coming from a very small place into a very large market a great growth opportunity for Intel that we're executing on aggressively.: Yes I'll start with that one and then Dave you can add. Overall CapEx is lumpy as we go through the year. And as such we think overall that we'll still be on track to the overall CapEx target that we laid out. We are working very aggressively with the equipment companies. And we have deep strong long-term relationships there. And clearly some of the '23 and '24 equipment goals are ones that we're working on aggressively right now but we do feel comfortable that we have the supply chains lined up to meet our equipment objectives and really importantly to meet the factory ramp cycles that we've laid out for the marketplace as we're opening up the new factories like we just announced. Our Oregon fab coming online. We have the next -- we're starting to take equipment now into our Ireland. We'll soon be doing that for our Israel fab ramp we'll be groundbreaking on Ohio later this year. We'll be talking more about the German fab. So one by one we're just executing on an aggressive build-out of our capital network and really quite pleased with the relationship that we have with the equipment companies to make that possible. That said there definitely is some pressure on the equipment supply chain. We're also working closely with the equipment vendors. Many of them use Intel FPGAs. So we're working closely to make sure that we prioritize that piece of the demand to support them in that requirement. Dave anything else you'd add?: Yes. And I'll start on that one. Overall the DCAI performed a little bit better than we expected for Q1. So I'd say overall this is what we expected. The biggest factor on margins was the ramp of the 10-nanometer product line and the costs associated with that. So that was the biggest factor associated with it. As we're looking at that there also was I'll say relative strength in the cloud piece of that business the hyperscalers and the enterprise piece of the business was a little bit more constrained by match set. So we did see a little bit of that effect in Q1. As we go through the rest of the year we do see good outlooks on both the hyperscaler as well as on the enterprise and government side. We're working aggressively to solve the match set problems. So we are hopeful that we'll be able to do a bit better in that area if we are able to address some of the shortages that we've seen in areas like Ethernet. Obviously as we go into the second half of the year the product line gets stronger. As we see Sapphire Rapids ramp we'll be launching products like Sapphire Rapids HBM and the HPC segment weâ€™ll be ramping Ice Lake more aggressively with higher volumes as we go into the second half of the year. So all of those start moving the product line in the right direction and margins commensurately with it. We also have gotten great response for the longer-term view of our segment and road map. And as we've laid out we'll have both the efficient cores as well as the performance cores which better satisfy the market requirements. And I believe that will be a factor of better pricing as better -- as well as better margins over time because you're not trying to stretch one product across really 2 distinct segments of the marketplace and really having highly optimized products for both the hyperscaler as well as the broader enterprise requirements. So overall we think that the strategy that we've laid out we've gotten great response from our customers for and as I already indicated we're executing as we set Sapphire Rapids' first PRQs this quarter many more as we go through the rest of the year and we'll be ramping that aggressively and seeing a good response from the customers. And I'd also say particularly with Sapphire Rapids every hyperscaler every OEM has many SKUs lined up for this. This product will be extremely well respected accepted and broadly deployed in the marketplace this year. Dave anything else you would add?: Yes. And on the first part of it clearly the implications of foundry timing is something we have to work very carefully. And there is not just a question of the timing of a node it's also the capacity of nodes. And with some of those changes that have been reported in the industry we're just working through that with our product teams to make sure that we're aligning well to the availability of the foundry technologies. But I would say that our IDM model just gives us fundamentally an advantaged business model here where given the majority of our volumes are internal we are able to balance between what we use externally for wafers and what we use internally for wafers. And thus we're able to do a much better job satisfying our customers and having a more competitive product line. I'd also again add Tim that our execution of our 5 nodes in 4 years on or ahead of schedule across it this just reinforces the competitiveness that we've described where we do see ourselves coming back to a position of unquestioned process technology leadership and we're building out the manufacturing capacity at scale to deliver that to our customers. So IDM 2.0 well leveraging the foundries but even more importantly building leadership technologies with that scale manufacturing to deliver the most robust product line in the industry. So Dave?: Yes. Thank you. And the answer is yes we're going to be delivering the GPU products first for mobile as we said next for desktop. It will be game-centric as we're bringing them out of the marketplace. But we're also going to have a full lineup and we see actually some very unique advantages as we think about media some of the professional developers where we're already demonstrating radically advantage that positions like on some of the advanced graphics and media artist product lines. So these will be areas of strength. Particularly when we bring our Arctic Sound product into the marketplace later this year this will be well optimized for GPU environments and particularly will be strong in areas like encoding and media processing as well that if you think about cloud you can certainly think about AI and training workloads but many clouds are actually spending far more time on transcoding and media operations. So that will be an area of unique strength of our Arctic Sound product line. So and -- so if you think about that taken together we'll be competing in the integrated graphics the discrete graphics the GPU business the high-performance computing business will really be leveraging that technology across the entire space of the market. And that's part of the reason that we're very encouraged by our ability to ramp this into a very significant business for Intel and one where we have a lot of advantages to build upon.: Yes. Great question Srini. And clearly one of the things that Intel as the market leader right the volume leader it is this ability to ramp key new technologies. And with the Sapphire platform comes DDR5. And if we were talking 90 days ago we were fighting through some challenges on DDR5 with the memory of suppliers and really working on debugging those interfaces. We now feel very confident that multiple suppliers are now qualified. We're seeing good momentum from the memory partners in this area they're ramping up their supply chains for the Sapphire platform right? It's really that one that brings a major new memory technology into the marketplace and really reinforces Intel as the leader in data center and server market. Overall we're modeling very carefully your exact question about looking at this versus the Ice Lake ramp. And our objective is to ramp this platform meaningfully faster than we did the Ice Lake platform. We're doing a lot of work for the software stack the validation of that making sure that we've really worked through all of the early sitings that customers would have driving down the defect rates in the platform that our customers can ramp this at volume. And as I already indicated we're seeing a tremendous amount of SKUs and instance types across all of the OEMs as well as all of the hyperscalers in the marketplace and we're looking forward to those being broadly available in the second half of the year. As we -- and I think then maybe just wrapping up the call today we're grateful for all of you joining us the opportunity to update you on the business. It's great that we start the year with a beat. We are looking at the momentum of the execution machine of Intel seeing solid progress so 5 nodes in 4 years Alder Lake Sapphire Rapids Arc launch increasing momentum with our customers. We remain true to this building out of a geographically-balanced and more resilient supply chain. And there's just lots of good things in flight that gives us confidence not only in Q2 but to reaffirm our guidance for the year. And our leadership team we're fired up and we believe that this is the greatest turnaround story in history and it's my honor as the CEO of this great company to be able to be part of this leadership team. So thank you all for joining us today.,0.396466285,0.989375114,0.426907949
43,43,HON,Adamczyk:,Thank you.Good morning.Yes. I mean let me maybe start on the second of your two questions. So in terms of defense and space our orders in Q1 were actually quite good. They were double-digit orders growth in defense and space. But I wouldnâ€™t tell you that weâ€™re seeing a big uptick yet due to some of the geopolitical situation. But we do think it could happen. But weâ€™re not going to call it that itâ€™s going to happen until we see it. So the orders growth in Q1 although good is not really tied to any of the geopolitical situation. And particularly in HPS we saw good orders growth in Q1. We actually anticipate some strong orders in UOP particularly tied to some of our gas portfolio. So that looks good. So thatâ€™s sort of your second question. Greg...And just to add to that I mean if you take a look at our backlog which youâ€™ve just provided commercial activity is not our issue. I think commercial activity is about as strong as weâ€™ve ever seen it. You see the improving backlog positions orders positions. And I think this is all about supply chain. And there is still unknowns around supply chain. I think on the semiconductor side we probably have seen the bottom. But I would tell you the aerospace supply chain is still challenged. And our de-commit rate from our suppliers is high. And thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so hard to call this thing because when you get a pretty high de-commit rate itâ€™s difficult to call exactly what thatâ€™s going to look like in Q2 Q3 and Q4. So we remain optimistic that itâ€™s going to continue to improve. But weâ€™ve got to kind of see it in the numbers.Thank you.Good morning Jeff.Yes. I mean I think itâ€™s a couple of things. So I would characterize it the following. And we donâ€™t release specific numbers to that project. But think about it as two dimensions. The first one is licensing and the technology itself which can be recognized in one or two different ways either an upfront paid-up license or a license thatâ€™s recognized as a royalty rate as SAF is produced. And then the second stream being the use of the catalyst itself to actually drive that SAF conversion. So this is not the only project that weâ€™re going to be involved with. When we look at SAF and green fuels weâ€™ve won something like a double-digit number of projects in the last call it 6 to 9 months as weâ€™ve been on an incredible run. Itâ€™s just one example of what we do. At some point weâ€™re going to give you a bit of a framework. Weâ€™re not ready to share that yet in terms of exactly what it looks like. But itâ€™s going to be definitely margin-accretive. And you should think about it very much like you said as a recurring revenue base based on the catalyst reloads which are going to be required to drive either SAF or green fuels and green gasoline.Thanks Jeff.Hi good morning Scott.Yes. No see now we are ongoing working our price. I mean we basically are bumping up sort of the benefit of price by 1 percentage point. I think the one thing that Scott that I think you picked up I mean essentially in this guide it is a substantial raise to our guide range. I mean we didnâ€™t explicitly say that but itâ€™s obvious. Because we are basically absorbing a $400 million hit due to Russia with commensurate margin rate of over $100 million. So this is a fairly significant raise to our outlook. The way we can overcome that hit is through price. And we think now we are basically projecting an incremental point of price to a range of 5% or so.Yes. And because we started doing this price increase a bit more aggressively in Q4 and Q1 obviously as we get later in the year that starts to lap itself. Although I will tell you that we are going to stay on top of this thing and we are continuing to chase inflation and trying to stay ahead. And obviously we have to do more price increases here in Q2 to continue to stay ahead of it.Yes. Thanks Scott.Good morning.Yes. No I mean I think as you saw in the quarter we had very good order rates I mean double-digit north of 20% order rates in HPS. UOP was a little lumpy. Frankly our LST business was strong. Our UPT was a little bit less so we expect a strong booking quarter in Q2. We will be â€“ overall particularly for UOP we see strong orders growth particularly as it relates to our natural gas-oriented portfolio. So think about absorbents gas processing midstream LNG terminals and all that business itâ€™s â€“ we are a big partner of Venture Global to some of the projects that they are completing and their expansion. So overall we are very bullish in terms of whatâ€™s going on particularly as it relates to the gas infrastructure thatâ€™s currently being built up both in North America the Middle East and Europe.Thank you.Yes. UOP gets disproportionately â€“ I talked about the 1% hit for our revenues for the year. Thatâ€™s disproportionately UOP-related. And you saw that already in Q1. So thatâ€™s just to help that frame it up. As it relates to your second question I mean essentially in terms of Russia oil I mean simplistically said instead of flowing less we think itâ€™s going to start flowing south. And I think the good news about us is that we have a global presence across the West and the South. And I think that benefits obviously a lot of our PMT businesses. And as I mentioned earlier kind of the gas infrastructure build-out in Western Europe which will take place both in Western Europe but also in the Middle East and in the U.S. will also have positive benefit to our business. So all-in-all I mean I think we are well positioned there.I mean thatâ€™s hard to answer right now. I think we are still kind of weeks into this conflict so we will see. I mean we are obviously involved in a lot of the discussions of the new projects and so on but â€“ and I am very very confident that any of the build-out thatâ€™s going to take place particularly of our modular design concepts which really revolutionized LNG I am quite confident that we are going to be a player in that space.Thank you.Good morning.Yes. I mean let me start. I mean if you think about price/cost the price inflation think about a 7% and 5% number in that kind of neighborhood. I mean we â€“ this is really the benefit of Honeywell Digital. We talked a lot about that at Investor Day. But I now can tell you exactly on the impact of price/cost for every of our 37 business units and exactly what itâ€™s going to look like going forward for the next three quarters. And I can tell you that in bps. Itâ€™s really enabled us to establish an operating system where we know what we need to do in terms of price. We know what we do in terms of coverage and where that business unit will be. And itâ€™s a weekly rhythm that we are on with all the businesses. As a matter of fact we have got a meeting later on today to talk about that topic and we continue to stay on top of it. But itâ€™s not as simple in some businesses than others. I mean some businesses we have contractual obligations contractual limitations in terms of what we can pass on and when. And we are finding ways to be â€“ to do that. I mean everybody knows that inflation is with us. Itâ€™s probably going to continue to be with us. We are going to stay diligent and we are very pleased with our results and able to stay ahead of the price/cost. I think Greg do you have anything you want to add?Good morning.Yes. I mean there is â€“ yes there is a lot of variables here. Let me try to unpack it a little bit. I mean HBT and SPS the supply chain is complex due to the variety installed base of our products. It is somewhat contained primarily to the semiconductors. And when you think about semiconductors you are talking about the 5 to 10 core suppliers that we are monitoring. So itâ€™s actually a little bit easier for us to get our arms around the situation and know when things will come in when they wonâ€™t come in. And we are cautiously optimistic about an improving supply source coming through for Q2 Q3 and Q4. And frankly looking into Q2 from the beginning vis-Ã -vis Q1 or Q4 we actually looked a little bit better than we did in the other quarters. So we have reason to be cautiously optimistic provided we donâ€™t get de-commits on semiconductors. Now when you get into the Aero segment it actually becomes a bit more challenged. And to give you some very specific numbers our level of de-commits which is sort of last-minute cancellations or push-outs was at a level of 22%. I mean thatâ€™s what makes it so difficult. It was actually worse than in Q4 where it was about 19%. We are counting on some improvement in Q2 and Q3 and Q4. But now you are not talking about less than 10 suppliers you are talking about tens if not hundreds of suppliers. And trying to really figure out exactly how well they are going to deliver and when it becomes more challenging. Obviously we have deployed our own people our resources to that supply base to help them through some of their capacity challenges. We have got a program around that. But it is challenged. And I canâ€™t tell you that we have a full and perfect view as to exactly whatâ€™s going to happen. We are working through it. And as you can see we certainly have the backlog more than to support the business. And we are not just watching. We are actually doing and we have got a substantial force of people to just work there at aero supply chain.Yes. I mean that target keeps moving. But we think in the â€“ certainly in the first half of May we expect some ease-off in terms of the Shanghai lockdowns. Thatâ€™s what we have built into our guidance if you will.Yes. And to be â€“ just a couple of other things here I mean yes I mean as Greg pointed out wide-body travel has been still constrained and limited. And thatâ€™s still upside to go for us given particularly our installed base on those aircraft. But the fact is if you look at our backlog position we are in tremendous shape in Aerospace. And probably the biggest issues we see is in defense and space where we have a growing past-due backlog at a faster rate than even some of the other segments. So really we donâ€™t â€“ we are not that worried about the commercial inbound. And we saw just an incredible order rate strong double-digit order rate in Q1. All our focus is really on output in the supply chain. We get that going I think very very good very very quickly becauseâ€¦Thank you.Good morning Deane.Well because we are really not seeing a lot of new orders yet to some of the geopolitical conflicts to replenish the inventories. I mean I think â€“ and by the way checking with some of the other OEs thatâ€™s not necessarily unusual so that could be an uptick. When we talked about at Investor Day there was some built-in optimism around that coming in. And I still think it will happen. I am just not going to call it yet until we actually see the orders coming through. Having said that we did see double-digit orders growth in defense and space in Q1 just naturally without the addition of plus-ups in the defense budget. So I think it could still be at that level. I am just not going to call that until we actually see it more pronounced in our orders rate. And I am still optimistic that it will happen.Thank you Deane.Hi Andy good morning.You just nailed it Andy. Yes thatâ€™s exactly â€“ you have got it exactly right which is as we look in because we look at short cycle and long cycle. And you see now a little bit of a transition from its slow because short cycle is still very good for us but now we are starting to slowly see that long cycle coming through. You see it in our backlog. You see it in our order rates. And now itâ€™s the time of the cycle where the long cycle businesses will start to have a bit more traction. And a lot of people are saying there may or there may not be a recession in the next 6 months to 12 months to 18 months. But I certainly hope it doesnâ€™t happen. But if it does I actually think that Honeywell can weather the storm quite well given the kind of backlog position in the markets we are in which is energy and aerospace which frankly have been hurt disproportionally hard during the pandemic and now are starting to come back strong. So I am very very optimistic about kind of the position the backlog we are in. And I think you said it exactly right we are seeing kind of a transition occurring slowly but surely. And itâ€™s not because our short cycle is weak but the long cycle is now starting to slowly pick up.Yes. Nice. Thank you Andy.I want to thank our shareholders for your ongoing support. We delivered strong first quarter results in a typical Honeywell fashion and have and will continue to navigate the numerous uncertainties with operational rigor and agility in order to drive superior shareholder returns. Thank you all for listening and please stay safe and healthy.,0.00270621,0.003055871,0.000209462
44,44,NKE,Donahoe:,And Erinn to the second part of your question on -- in that context investment weâ€™re doing what strong companies do during periods of time like this. Weâ€™re going to continue to invest in innovation and product creation in brand and storytelling and support of sport being back and our strong sports marketing portfolio and our digital transformation. So thatâ€™s continuing. And then weâ€™ll continue with strong presence around driving demand and brand even in the face of a supply-constrained market and as Matt mentioned accelerate air transportation and other things in our supply chain that allow us to take -- manage every lever we can in this supply chain-constrained environment. So weâ€™re going to -- again our mantra going into this next phase is the same mantra we had going into the first phase of the pandemic. Letâ€™s make sure we emerge stronger coming out of it than we have even today going in.Well Matthew on the first part of your question the healthy athletic market is in our remarks. Sport is back. And that is just such an energizing and important thing for NIKE. And we saw that this summer. I wonâ€™t go back through it whether itâ€™s the Olympics basketball global football incredible U.S. Open Tennis; it goes college football U.S. football back. I mean itâ€™s -- so I would say traditional sports is what Iâ€™ll call it is strong and back. And thatâ€™s also happening now in high schools and grade schools as kids come back to school. Second thing weâ€™re seeing is the expansion of the definition of sport whether thatâ€™s in the Olympics with sports like skate being included for the first time. Some of the most exciting moments in the Olympics was around skate right and as that young generation Gen Z generation really dominating remarkably in a very compelling way. But also coming out of pandemic the definition of sport I think is getting to every athlete -- asterisk in different ways just the concept of movements and health and the fact that sport can happen in your living room as well as going to the gym or the yoga studio or the basketball court. And so part of the tailwind weâ€™re seeing is sport is becoming part of everyoneâ€™s everyday life. And thatâ€™s a powerful tailwind for us. And then athleisure thatâ€™s blurring the line between the sport part of your life and the rest of your life is also what we view as a tailwind. So weâ€™re doubling down on traditional sport on capitalizing on these -- the new emerging definition of sport. You saw that in skate in the Olympics. You see that in some of our brand campaigns being really close to where that Gen Z consumer is. And we think that bodes well for our future.Matt why donâ€™t I take the first part of Mikeâ€™s question you take the second for North American. On China Michael Iâ€™ll just reiterate what I said last quarter is we take a long-term view in China weâ€™ll invest for the long term and weâ€™re confident in the long-term opportunity. And coincidentally this is the 40th -- this month is the 40th anniversary of NIKEâ€™s participation in China. And we saw Q1 results that were roughly in line with our expectations. And as Matt said supply constraints will impact our second quarter performance. But we are continuing to do what frankly Phil has done from the beginning in China which heâ€™s done over the last 40 years and weâ€™ve done and we will continue to do over the next 40 which is deliver innovative product that connects with local consumers strong consumer connections to our brand partly reinforced by the 7 000 monobrand stores across the country. Weâ€™re blessed to have a really strong local team and I am so proud of that team how theyâ€™re navigating through. As weâ€™ve said many times before they have led us in the sort of pandemic playbook and they continue to be very responsive on the ground there. And then we always have been and will continue to be very respectful and responsible corporate citizens promoting sport and the wellbeing through activity and promoting sustainability and other important societal themes. And so weâ€™ll continue to stay on that playbook and invest with consistency and longevity during this period of time.Bob I am so glad you asked. I had a SNKRS win this morning on the NOCTA line the vest. Iâ€™m excited. Itâ€™s a great collection. Any time you went on SNKRS itâ€™s a jolt. I was in the middle of my workout in one of our gyms here on campus. I stopped the workout at 7 a.m. to see if I won and I won. So Iâ€™m pumped up about that as our -- as we said earlier in all seriousness millions and millions of SNKRS users. What a great experience. And obviously that line is just another example of how NIKE is unparalleled in our ability to create real innovative stylish heat and connection with the consumer.And I might just build on that Kimberly to say both Matt and I wish we had a crystal ball but we donâ€™t. And one of the things that I think we are demonstrating through this very dynamic phase is regardless of what the future holds weâ€™re capitalizing on it right? Weâ€™re doing what great sports teams do which is making -- confronting the reality making adjustments showing agility and executing in a way where we emerge stronger. And so we had demand shocks last year with the closing of retail in the phase 1 of pandemic. And now weâ€™ve got some supply shocks with phase 2 of the pandemic this year. We will navigate through those just as we did last year. I think weâ€™re stronger today than we were 18 months ago and weâ€™ll be stronger 18 months from now than we are today. And in the process weâ€™re building that capability where weâ€™re leveraging our strengths and weâ€™re leveraging the leadership position. And I just want to maybe conclude this call Paul by once again just expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation for the 75 000 NIKE teammates around the world who day in and day out are adjusting to the circumstances on the field are demonstrating teamwork and resilience and creativity to serve consumers and continuing to innovate. And thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll continue to do regardless of what the future deals us.,0.002958695,0.003569543,0.000439076
45,45,QCOM,Amon:,Thanks for the question. Here is -- it's a complicated thing here. I'll try to provide a simple answer. Look when we talk for example -- and I was just going to pick this product an example. We talked about Snapdragon 8 Series Generation 1 and it's a leading node SoC but it has a lot of attach. Yes yes. The transceiver has entire front end attach. It has power management IC. And at the end of the day when we provide a chipset solution to our customers we need capacity across a number of different nodes. So when we think about multi-sourcing our products and put capacity expansion plans in place so we have supply to support both our handsets in the growth business we have been building capacity across all those different technologies. And as an example when you think of things like a power management IC or even transceiver we work with four or five foundries. So in the semiconductor supply chain shortage it is across everything. Now having said that the second part of the answer is scale has been very helpful. Two things have been very helpful for Qualcomm. One is the high predictability we have on our demand. We can bet on ourselves and therefore we have the ability to make long-term capacity planning and get long-term capacity commitments from our vendors. And also the scale that we have to be able to utilize multisourcing that has put us in a good position to navigate through this. Now having said that so I'll repeat what I said before we still have more demand than supply even though we're very happy with the growth rates and how good was the quarter the guide how we've been managing I think the seasonality between handsets and the growth business. But -- and as we said supply is going to get better as we get to the second half of 2022.Thanks for the question. Automotive is really an incredible opportunity for Qualcomm. We're super excited about everything is happening automotive has happened in a very short period of time. And I think we have something that is very unique. It's separate us from everybody else. So it's not about having a component. It's about creating a digital chassis with capabilities in all domains from connecting the car to the cloud telematics the entire immersive digital cockpit experience and of course ADAS and autonomy plus a service platform. GM is as we said a cornerstone customer that is not only looking into the capability of ADAS and we're super proud of the work with them on both the Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise but also the ability to look of the entire chassis. BMW was another one which we announced towards our Analyst Day. At CES we announced Renault as an addition to the digital chassis. We -- you should expect that we have a lot of other irons in the fire. And overall automotive is a good story for Qualcomm. It's something that we can actually take a platform approach and take some of the things we have done in mobile it's take the technology to scale up and down to every tier of automobile. And I think we're just in the beginning of having more ADAS design wins and having the chassis be recognized as a key platform going forward.No it's a great question. And I think as we've been trying to talk about on this call when you think about the handset Android revenue for us and the growth for having in Android you see a lot of growth right now. You saw that 60% year-over-year growth of Android and we also have sequential growth. That's because of the Chinese New Year. And we're more skewed towards premium and high tier. And then we have -- the next inflection point will be the holiday season. And I think this is all contemplated in our guide. And the market -- we continue to see demand high. And because I think we're more concentrated in the premium and high tiers we have been a little bit less impacted by some of the puts and takes that you see towards in the mid and the low tier of handsets.Great question. Look let's talk about short term and then let's talk about midterm. The way we look at this -- and we have been very clear and very consistent with our vision. At the end of the day for Qualcomm it's inevitable that you're going to have a big portion of the PC market moving towards the connected ARM platform. I think you saw that happening already with Apple when you think about the Apple devices. And then when you think about the use cases of PC PCs are changing at least for the workhorse of a laptop. It's about cameras. It's about connectivities. It's about multimedia. It's about streaming with 5G including streaming of gaming etcetera. So our view is very clear. There's going to be a big portion of the market is going to transition to an ARM architecture. And when you think of everybody else in the industry we are the best positioned company to do that for the Windows ecosystem. I think that's reflected not only in the developments and the partnership we have with Microsoft for the years but also the acquisition of NUVIA. Short term as we prepare for Windows 11 Windows 11 is really the time that you have the ARM ecosystem able to support 32-bit 64-bit. You have things like the Android apps coming to Windows. Our new partner we just announced the 8cx Gen 3. We talk about CES about having now the device being tested in 200 large enterprises. And it's a step function. We'll continue to work with our partners on that transition. But I think every OEM that you're going to talk to especially on the PC Windows side they believe there's going to be a room for ARM-based laptop and that's what Qualcomm is doing.Yes. First of all I would like to thank everyone for joining on the call today. I'm really excited for what 2022 will bring. Demand for technology is accelerating across virtually every sector and we remain at the beginning of one of the largest opportunities in our history. Our one technology road map with -- in comparable capabilities in wireless communications low-power advanced computing and on-device AI extends from mobile to automotive and IoT expanding our addressable market by more than seven times to approximately $700 billion in the next decade. In closing we have the vision and the execution capabilities that will ensure we are at the forefront of innovation. As the world transforms we will continue to move early and quickly to address these new opportunities and deliver technologies that enable industries and communities to advance. Most important I would like to thank our 45 000 employees worldwide. I'm incredibly proud of the significant achievements we made. Thank you.,0.00388217,0.005489349,0.001159373
46,46,LOW,Ellison:,So Simeon this is Marvin. I think it's important for me to note that we're really pleased with the profit performance in the first half. For a retailer our size it is really difficult to have declining sales on a year-over-year basis and have leverage from an operating margin and gross margin perspective. That took a lot of work and a lot of operational discipline from the supply chain cost management payroll and expense management et cetera. And to Brandon's point we're in this unprecedented environment of lumber inflation and deflation. And so we're just planning conservatively because as we say the last couple of weeks we start to see lumber starting to shift and we're just anticipating that that's going to give us some headwind in Q2.So let me take -- this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of that. We've spent a lot of time putting in improved systems from a pricing standpoint. So we are scraping and we're doing pricing analysis real time both in-store and online by geography. One thing that Bill put in place early on when he arrived is an everyday competitive pricing strategy where we've gotten off this high-low promotional cadence that Lowe's was known for to more of an everyday competitive price. And the only way you can be competitive every day is you have to have a good line of sight to the competitive prices of your competition by category by geographic location. And so we've done a lot of that. And in some cases with inflation -- product inflation we have to carry that forward to the consumer. But in a lot of cases we're just focused on being competitively priced. And I'll let Brandon provide financial specifics of what that looks like.Karen I'll take the other question. When you think about our operating margin and you think about kind of the more structural differences between us and our largest competitor I think it really comes down to the penetration of DIY versus Pro. I think that's an obvious reflection in the first quarter. The good news for us is we're not setting a Pro penetration target. We just have an expectation we're going to continue to improve that business. And if you think about my prepared comments in the last 3 years we've been increasing our Pro penetration by roughly 600 basis points. So we feel like that we're headed in the right direction. But as you think about overall operating income we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and we have a very good line of sight to getting us to that 13% and beyond just based on executing our Total Home Strategy focusing on Pro online and all the work that Bill's team is doing on private brands and how we're continuing to grow that business. In the private brands specific initiative it drives margin improvement. It gives the customer great innovation and style and we can do it all at a really competitive price and it's a key point of differentiation in addition to all the investments we're making in infrastructure whether that's supply chain or store operations infrastructure. Again we feel like we have a clear line of sight and we're going to continue to execute to that and we have an expectation that we're going to be on track with delivering on that expectation.It's really more of an acknowledgment of what we're all seeing in just a broader macro economy. And I think what's interesting for home improvement is that we're aware that we have inflation concerns. We're aware that there are rising interest rates. But as we look at the home improvement sector we still remain very confident in the outlook and we're very confident in the sector. And so I'll just repeat what I've said. We've seen no material trade down from our customers. We closely monitor Pro and DIY. We look at it intently as you can imagine. And when we think about the key economic drivers of our business it remains home price appreciation. It remains the age of housing stock it remains those things that give the homeowner confidence of continuing to invest in the home. And as we talk to our Pro customers they're booked us for the year. We talked to our DIY customers they would just wait when this one come out. And so we feel good about the home improvement sector. And my statement was just more of an acknowledgment of the broader macro environment that we're all seeing.Liz it would be anecdotal at best. So we don't have any firm data to represent that. But our view of it and our conversations with Pros and consumers you tell us that your statement is correct. But again we don't have any fact-based data to support that.And Liz this is Martin again. I just want to reinforce the point on the value of home price appreciation to consumer confidence. And it's one of the reasons why I think home improvement is a unique retail sector in kind of this macro environment where there are a lot of questions about the health of the consumer. What our data tells us and it correlates historically is when your home value is going up you simply have more confidence to invest in that home because you see it as an investment and not an expense. And we have unprecedented home price appreciation but we also have an impressive supply-demand issue for the availability of homes. So our data tells us this is less of bubble and it's more of a supply-demand issue where you have 1.5 million 2 million homes of demand versus the availability. And so if you think about what Bill said about trading up our customers you feel more comfortable investing in home because they think they're going to get a return on that investment. And I think that's the value of home price appreciation to our business.So Zach this is Marvin. I'll take the first part of that and then I'm going to let Brandon and Joe provide some context. So relative to payroll we have an activity-based payroll model that allows us to flex hours up and down based on sales velocity by location of store but also by department. That is a significant contrast to what we had in place when I arrived in summer of 2018 that we literally were writing a contemplated schedule from Morrisville North Carolina and sending that out to every store on a weekly basis irrespective of volume trends. So I'll let Joe talk about payroll so you can get a view of why we were able to leverage as effectively as we did in Q1 and how we think that's a sustainable result that we'll see for the balance of the year.Well Zach we talked about our expectation to grow 2x the market in Pro. We think that that is achievable based on the list of Pro-related products that Bill and his merchant teams have added to our assortment based on our new MVP Loyalty Program that's exceeding expectations on the number of enrollments. And one other really interesting data point if we look at the Pro customers currently enrolled in our new MVP Loyalty Program and our credit program they're spending 300% more than Pro customers not enrolled. So it gives us a lot of confidence that our Pro growth is sustainable. And not to mention with some other initiatives that we are filing to include job site fulfillment that we think will give us an opportunity to start in the future to serve a large approach. So based on all of those initiatives we feel like that our Pro growth will continue. Look it's challenging none of us have a crystal ball obviously and there are a lot of dynamics in our Pro DIY mix. Having said that we factored all those things into our guidance and we think that the guidance as Brandon reinforced is reflected on our view of how we think the DIY Pro mix will play out for the rest of the year.,0.004256055,0.005778909,0.001173077
47,47,UPS,Tome:,Well Brian perhaps you want to talk more about the guidance?I would say interestingly in the SMB space it's now split 50:50 commercial-residential. And we saw our commercial business grow almost 4% in the first quarter. So we're going to take every opportunity to win in that space as well because service matters to that customer base.We want the business to be the best of our context as that meets the needs of the customers. And so we haven't declared what that mix should be but that's actually a pretty interesting challenge for us as team at our June strategy meeting to think about what â€“ where â€“ what do we want declare that mix to be.Thank you.So we haven't updated the market sizing in any material way since our June Investor Day. And when we do we will certainly share that with you.So we don't have direct insight to the consumer behavior. It's more from what we're hearing from our customers who are telling us there has been a bit of a shift from goods to services. And you're probably experiencing that if you've gone on vacations it seems like the hotels are full all the planes are full and people are going out to eat. And gosh I was in Washington D.C. last week and the bar was hoping at midnight. So people are spending money differently than they would. But as it relates to the guidance that we've given and we feel good about the volume that's coming back into our network and the guidance that we've laid out.Yes. What I've asked the team to do is to tell me how fast they can go because the â€“ the capital is not going to get in the way of speed here. Automation is critically important to deliver service for our customers as well as drive productivity. Of the automation activities we have underway be it automated label application or automated bagging or robotic sort induction it's a head count opportunity this year alone of 1 200 people inside our buildings and that's going to double next year and continue to take off. So we're not going to let perfection get in the way good enough here. We're going to go fast. As it relates to cybersecurity that's the one budget I will not touch. We continue to invest in cyber. It's a scary time for all of us but we are leaning in from a cyber perspective. Clearly if you think about the challenges coming out of Eastern Europe we have taken every system down. So we're at no risk there. But of course we could â€“ we have attacks on our company every day but our cyber team does a masterful job awarding off those attacks. And we're spending a lot of money to ensure that we protect our customer data our personal information of our people and all the incredible pricing information that we have that gives us a competitive advantage. So knock on wood of course because every company is vulnerable here but we're certainly investing in protection.Thank you.We freed up some capacity in our network to allow us to go out and win where in the past couple of years it was harder because of peak gating there's only so much volume a company like UPS can take into the network during peak. You only have so many doors for cars you only have so many buildings but because we've freed up some capacity we can actually give our customers more peak availability that's allowing us to win with great revenue quality. So right now we don't view that the revenue quality is at risk. And remember there is still a demand/supply imbalance and it's exasperated in certain parts of the country. So we are winning because of the SurePost.So if we look at our fuel surcharge as Brian mentioned is just part of our overall pricing algorithm and yes it does move off of the weekly change in the PPG index. But to that we add a pricing modifier. So think of it known differently than a demand surcharge or a network surcharge or just a plain price. And people are willing to pay for this because of the service we provide. If we look at the impact to our business in the first quarter for the domestic business alone 55% of the fuel benefit came from changes in the PPG index. 45% of the benefit came from actions that we took from a pricing perspective. We are always thoughtful about changes in pricing of course. We price for the services we provide. Many of our published prices as you know are also discounted. So I think that's something you need to keep in mind too as you think about are you adjusting too frequently? We price for the services we provide and then we also will discount but just on a discounting if I could we mentioned the new tool that we just introduced to which we call bill manager. And this is providing pricing analytics to our sales team as they go about negotiating deals. And in fact as we looked at our pilots 41% of our volume one and our volume rate wins or volume wins have increased from where they were trending. The discounting is lower in 41% of the volume wins than it had been using our old pricing science. So science rules in many ways when it comes to pricing you ask a lot of questions here about elasticity and what are you doing with pricing science really rules here as we think about providing the best overall equation for our customers.So the $500 million cost out target related to what we call non-ops or overhead and we initially had $1 billion target in which we delivered $500 million last year we're going to do it again this year. So that's tracking as we laid out very proud of the team for that. When you introduce technology it can free up a lot of manual activities. And we're really all about putting our resources where we can get the highest return. As it relates to the RFID technology boy we were worried about putting it in this year because of supply chain jams but we were able to procure all the batteries and labels that we need. So we will get it up this year before peak and a hundred of our centers. And what this will do long-term for us it looks pretty powerful wave one alone. It will eliminate all the manual scans done by our pre-loaders. If that doesn't drive productivity I don't know what will and it will avoid all the miss sorts when a package gets miss sorted and it goes into the wrong package car that's not a very good experience for our customer and it actually just a drag on productivity. So really excited about where that's going to take us long-term and the project is on tech. Nando is also driving what he calls total service which is running this network which was designed for perfection at perfection. We haven't been there for lots of reasons COVID and all kinds of reasons but it's pretty powerful because if you think about just delays and traffic or delays leaving the package centers it can cost a hundred of millions of dollars that relate. So running the network for the way it was designed is powerful and Nando just kicked this off. And will bringing you up to speed along this initiative as we go along.Well look I applaud the retail stores who are doing a masterful job of offering buy online pickup in a store buy online return in store come to my store come to my store come to my store because if they don't get traffic into their store well they'll deleverage that fixed cost. And then we'll have to close stores. So I admire what they're doing but there's still been a permanent shift in customer preferences. Customers want to shop when where and how they want to shop. And they want their packages delivered to them when where and how they want them. It might be inside of the store. It might be at their home or at their workplace or at a consolidated pickup point. So we're not going to see the kind of growth that we experience during COVID clearly but e-commerce sales will continue to grow. We want to serve that customer but we also want to serve the commercial customer because that's a very good customer for us. So while we may have said a 60/40 mix the mix is going to go where the volume is and we will lean into that growth appropriately.,0.003783807,0.00495398,0.000685591
48,48,COP,day.,The U.S. export terminals are running effectively at capacity or slightly above nameplate. I think that you've got several folks who are out in the market who are looking at taking FID but there's a practical reality that once you take FID it's several years to build these terminals. So I think if you're looking at impact in terms of immediate term or mid-decade I'd say it's closer towards mid-decade before you start seeing these new import -- these new export facilities online.,0.002985954,0.002985954,0
49,49,CAT,Umpleby:,Yes Steve I believe I mentioned commodity prices being supportive of RI as opposed to CI. But just to talk about CI a bit. Again we talked about residential non-residential improving infrastructure investments being made by various governments around the world. So those are all tailwinds for CI. The commodity prices certainly are supportive of investment in RI and of course E&T as well with oil prices.Well thanks for your question David. And as weâ€™ve been talking about for a couple of years weâ€™ve been expecting moderate increase over time in mining and thatâ€™s really how itâ€™s played out. Our customers are continue to display capital discipline. But in fact weâ€™re seeing investments weâ€™re seeing new orders for trucks. Parked trucks remain at low levels as utilization increases. In terms of coal certainly coal prices have been up for the last year or so remains to be seen exactly how this plays out. If there are prolonged restrictions on natural gas weâ€™re seeing in Europe and other places there in fact could be increased demand for coal. But having said that again weâ€™ve seen improved coal prices over the last year. And so commodities in the sector have been supportive of investment across a wide range of commodities and I put coal in that bucket as well.Good morning.You bet. Well weâ€™re pleased with services growth in the quarter. We released the annual services sales and revenues once a year. And so we will do that in January for full year 2022. Having said that we continue to make progress with our various initiatives. Weâ€™re pleased at the way things are going and weâ€™re still driving towards that target of doubling services sales between 2016 and 2026.Hi Chad.Well thanks for your question and we do feel good about our competitive position. Just starting quickly with solar they have a strong â€“ they have strong leadership in the market. And we are very pleased at the way they are positioned moving forward. On the recipe side we made a number of changes. As you know we made the acquisition of â€“ from were and we now have a more complete product line which really does put us in a we believe in a strong competitive position as our customers work to reduce their carbon footprint as they increased oil and gas production And as you can imagine particularly in North America there is a real strong focus by our oil and gas customers to do that. So again we feel good about the way we are positioned there with our portfolio now. E-fracking we have gas engines being purchased by our oil and gas customers for e-frac. So again a whole variety of things going on there. Customers are buying our DGB engine which allows them to substitute up to 85% diesel fuel with natural gas. So again we believe we are quite well positioned.Good morning Nicole.Hi Ross.Well thanks for your question. Firstly in terms of demand for CI in North America it is quite strong. And as I mentioned earlier supply chain challenges prevented us from having even higher sales in the quarter. Having said that Caterpillar has a strong rental business. If you add up Cat dealers across North America it is a strong business and something our dealers are very focused on. And we have a relatively new rental leader so we are working on improving our capabilities there. Having said that the real issue is supply chain. So if we had in fact more product we could have more product in the rental fleets and our dealers have to make decisions between putting units in the rental fleet and selling to customers because demand is strong everywhere. And so really this is a function of our ability to produce more product due to supply chain constraints as opposed to anything structural. Certainly rental is important. Itâ€™s a growing part of the business but itâ€™s one that we believe we are very well positioned to participate in. The big issue we have at the moment is again the ongoing supply chain challenges which we have been discussing.Good morning Courtney.Well we remain positive about mining and continue to see increases in user demand. And again itâ€™s playing out much as we have been predicting the last couple of years with improving market conditions improving orders and improving sales. So we feel good about that CapEx is up. Commodity prices remain certainly supportive of investment and we are seeing demand for both services parts and new machines. Parked trucks remain at low levels. Utilization has been increasing and a lot of interest in our â€“ in zero emissions as well. So we have seen a lot of announcements there things that we are doing with customers. Machine average age continues to increase. And so parts rebuilt in aftermarket services are expected to benefit from those aged fleets. So again mining is playing out much as we had anticipated.Yes. The way we characterized it here yes we do expect price to more than offset manufacturing cost increases in 2022 and we expect more of an impact of pricing in the second half versus the first half. We continually monitor the marketplace in terms of whatâ€™s going on from a competitive situation. We obviously take into account whatâ€™s happening from a cost perspective as well. And we have the flexibility to do what we need to do but we have taken pricing action. And again the pricing actions that we have taken will have a larger impact in the second half of the year versus the first. But certainly we always have the flexibility to do more if we believe thatâ€™s appropriate.Yes. Thank you. As you mentioned certainly the North American freight locomotive market is depressed. There is no question about it. We do have a services business that is doing well. We have hope for international this year as well. Hard to answer your question itâ€™s very difficult to predict what the railroads would do over the next couple of years. I mean we can â€“ anyone on the call can build competing cases there for whatâ€™s happening. So there is still parked locomotives. On the other hand everyone knows whatâ€™s going on with some of the freight constraints in the U.S. as well. So we will have to see how it all plays out. We are seeing interest in our battery electric locomotives that are used in switching applications. And we are pleased with that and you probably have read about an agreement that we have to work on longer term solution for hydrogen-based locomotive as well. So again very difficult to predict what the railroads would do but I certainly concur that currently the market for freight locomotives in North America is quite depressed.Good morning John.Good morning Jerry.We brought and we say as I mentioned earlier certainly mining is playing out the way we expected in terms of increased orders. Our lead times are not extended as anywhere near as much as they were during the prior peak a number of years ago but we are working with our customers and are working very hard to meet their lead time requirements. And I think we are quite close to that.,0.002890334,0.003233075,0.000224273
50,50,SPGI,Steenbergen:,Good morning George. Indeed as Doug said we are expecting still the second quarter to see some impact with respect to our quarterly expectations but then to see some improvement in the second half of this year and particularly also because the comps will get easier during the second half of this year. I also would like to point out of course the benefits we have of the broader company we are at this point in time because five of our -- the six divisions are performing in line or better than expectations. We will see during the course of this year coming in the benefits from our cost synergies the benefits from our buyback program and so on. So that should help drive the earnings per share growth in a very strong way during the rest of the year. Hence that we're still guiding to double-digit EPS growth for the full year. So definitely those elements will help to strengthen the performance of the company during the course of 2022.Yes let me give you a quick overview for each of the divisions and happy to go deeper in some of the next questions. But for example Market Intelligence we are incredibly excited about the opportunity. The first conversations we are having with customers are really showing the benefit of the combined company. And we saw actually the subscription revenue going up in a very strong way actually growing more in the double-digit space. Commodity Insights very strong commercial momentum. The main issue with respect to the Russian revenue impact will be in Commodity Insights but we expect to be able to offset a significant part of that based on the very strong commercial momentum we are seeing and also very excited about what we can offer our customers on a combined basis. Mobility clearly some positive trends as well as we have pointed out particularly because we see higher retention of our customers. The Index business a strong AUM growth. Keep in mind we are looking at this year-over-year. And of course we started at much lower AUM levels at the beginning of 2021 and then also the derivative activity and volumes are much higher. And then you also saw Engineering Solutions growing in a healthy way during the quarter. So overall we think that our businesses are very well-positioned five of the six and that the issues with respect to the debt issuance environment are very isolated within the Ratings division itself. And also keep in mind that we have a significant component in Ratings with respect to non-transaction revenue. So that is clearly also an element of stability and offset for the overall transactional revenue.Yes we are always looking Manav at the actual asset levels. And then we are assuming with respect to the growth and market appreciation a very modest development for the remainder of the year. But keep in mind that this is a business where we have the natural offset the partial hedge because if the asset levels will come down we see the derivative trading activity going up and the other way around. And as you have seen this quarter actually the Index business has performed very well based on those kind of dynamics. So if you look at it historically the Index business actually has been growing revenues for many many years in a row in very volatile market circumstances very different circumstances over the years. And that is exactly due to the dynamics of the business and the business model that we have the different revenue streams in the Index business.Good morning Ton. You're right. There are many different elements that go in the mix with respect to our margin expectation. But let me first reemphasize our margin expectations. So what we are guiding to is still 130 basis points margin expansion during 2022. And the reason is we will see some natural growth in our businesses. We of course have our business as usual expense growth based on the activities of the business. We of course have some impact of the overall compensation environment. We have done some targeted increases in certain job groups. We have raised the merit in certain jurisdictions a bit higher than we have done in previous years. But then at the same time we also have several management actions that we are taking. Definitely in the current environment we're of course very careful from an expense perspective. So we will see benefits from some of those management actions. We also have the benefit of some of our variable expenses that will come down during the course of this year. And then if you layer on top of that the cost synergies that will be very meaningful and significant we are actually very pleased that in an environment -- macro environment where we are today that we as a company still can improve our margins increase our margins in a very significant way.Yes. Toni with respect to our own effort 6.5% to 8% revenue growth for '22 and '23 combined we have no reason to back away from that at this point in time. But obviously we will continue to monitor that very closely. And the reason is that as we mentioned five of our six divisions are performing in line or better than expected. So the main question is when is the issuance environment coming back. And we have been in that movie many times before. If you look back for the last decade there's maybe three situations where the issuance environment was negative and there were impacts on the Ratings revenue. But what we usually have seen then is after one or a few quarters that came back in a very strong way. So it is really the matter of the uncertainty about the timing when that is coming back. So for that reason we have no reason at this moment to back away from our revenue expectations for '22 and '23 combined.Thanks Toni.Yes. Thank you Ashish. I think it's important first to point out that we are in these results only 1-month in as a combined company. So in that context that we are already being able to report $123 million of cost synergies on an annualized basis we think actually thatâ€™s already a very strong indicator. With respect to the absolute number and the phasing of our cost synergies nothing has changed compared to our information that we provided on March 1 during the merger call. But what is important to point out is that we made good progress. We are very comfortable and confident that we can hit those numbers. And you recall that we said that we will be able to achieve about $600 million of cost synergies in total and that we expect something like 35% to 40% in 2022 so realized in this year. And as I said we are very confident that we are on track to hit those numbers.Alex yes let me give you a bit of the breakdown and explanation what is happening exactly in recurring variable. You're right. If you look at MI as a whole approximately 83% is subscription-based 5% is non-subscription. And then you have that category in between that is subscription variable at approximately 12%. There you see a bit more impact from market fluctuations capital market fluctuations because that's the business that has some of those capital markets platforms some of the origination platforms some of the equity platforms. And that is being impacted by some of the general M&A and capital market activity and issuance environment that we are seeing both in fixed income and equity in the markets. And yes that is a market and a business where you see a bit of that impact. But overall you see that the Market Intelligence nevertheless was growing in a very strong way. And when we see more stability in the markets over time when we see the M&A environment coming back we would also expect to see the subscription variable component growing faster again. So thatâ€™s the underlying dynamic that is happening in the MI business.Thanks Alex.So if you look at non-transaction there is a bit of a mix of elements that go into that bucket. What we see is particularly strength in annual fees. So for example that is surveillance and of course with more bonds and loans outstanding after the very strong issuance environment over the last 2 years we see some benefit from that. Also frequent issuer fees are going in that category. So that is also very stable. And at the same time we see also the CRISIL performance that goes in non-transaction being very strong. So CRISIL is growing very rapidly both on the domestic Indian Ratings business as well as in the global research risk and benchmarking business. Where we see in the non-transaction bucket the revenue are not moving up it's mostly Rating Evaluation Services less M&A activity. So that is impacting Rating Evaluation Service and also new issuer credit ratings. Given the current environment we also see less activity there. Nevertheless of course 7% is a nice growth for non-transaction. We would probably see that slowing down that growth a little bit for the remainder of the year but I would expect it still to be in a positive territory.Yes first on the portfolio we are very committed on driving growth and success of each of our businesses at this point in time. We see multiple opportunities as we mentioned during the prepared remarks of value creation across the enterprise. There's a lot of cross links we are seeing with respect to revenue synergies. And I think it's really exciting to see what we can do altogether. Having said that you know us and our management style and philosophy will always be very disciplined portfolio managers. And we will always determine ultimately over time if we are the best owners of certain assets. But at this moment really our focus on driving the economic value generation of the portfolio of businesses we have at S&P Global.And maybe one quick addition on cloud. There is a bit of a bubble [ph] cost mostly in Market Intelligence because we are still in the transition there in that particular segment from on-prem to the cloud. So we would expect over time to see that expense growth to go away. So it's more transitional in terms of the expense impact on the Market Intelligence segment. With respect to the buyback question Owen we expect that the current $7 billion ASR program will be completed at the beginning of August. And then we are ready to enter into the next phase of our buyback program to complete the full $12 billion at the end of 2022.Thanks Owen.I think if you look at that Craig we always start with what is the added value we deliver for our customers. What is -- what will contribute in terms of usage what kind of data sets are these proprietary data sets hard-to-achieve data sets how are we embedded in workflows and processes? That is the starting point. And then we look at the overall value we generate for the enterprise and think about what is appropriate in terms of pricing and price increases for such a contract going forward. So we don't just look at that simply by a percentage. We always look at first what do we deliver to the customers and then reason back to what is appropriate in terms of the economic level of the fee that we will charge to the customer.Yes that is a bit speculative Craig as you understand. So I have to be careful answer that question in a too specific way. But you know our management philosophy and approach. We always will be looking to raise the bar to find new opportunities to leave no stone unturned. We will be looking across the whole company about what we can do better more efficient where we can integrate where we have opportunities to automate where we can use AI and Kensho across the board. So that is what we are planning to do. I think you know that the biggest areas of integration will be in Market Intelligence Commodity Insights and in Corporate. So if we will find upside ultimately in synergies most likely it's in those areas. But again we will be continuing to look for opportunities across the board.Thanks Craig.And one quick addition to Doug's answer. Although you're right Jeff that the direct cost synergies in Ratings will be relatively small Ratings will be a beneficiary of cost synergies in the Corporate segment that is being allocated to all divisions. And because Ratings has a very large base in revenues and employees based on those allocation keys Ratings will be in the end also significant beneficiary from the corporate cost synergies that we will accomplish.It's based on management's best estimates our own internal forecasting models which is the midpoint the best estimate point that the Ratings Research Group has put out in terms of the issuance outlook. So that is that minus 5% level.Thanks Jeff.Yes. Faiza first of all welcome to the call and we are very happy that you're part of the analyst group now covering us as a company. So first on Commodity Insights in terms of the expectation in terms of revenue growth for the year we have said mid single digits. And then in terms of margins mid to high 40s. And nothing has changed there compared to what we said to you a few months ago. And what you see is maybe first I should speak about the impact of the Russian situation and the fact that we have suspended our commercial activities with Russian customers. Overall not material for the company as a whole but the largest impact is in Commodity Insights. But as I said at the answer of a previous question we are very pleased to see the commercial momentum in the Commodity Insights business and we expect that they are able to make up a significant part of that during the course of this year. So that's clearly a positive. You're right that revenues looked a bit high during the quarter 14%. But take into account that we had that CERAWeek event that had a significant impact on revenues during the first quarter. If you take CERAWeek out revenue increase was approximately 8% during the quarter. So still strong but definitely at a different level. Final commentary is we are really excited to see what is happening in that business because you could say there is in fact really a benefit of two trends at the same time. Traditional energy doing well. Of course with the current commodity prices you see that producers are in a healthy situation. And then there is so much focus at the same time on energy transition that we will have a benefit of helping our customers on both angles and thatâ€™s clearly driving some of the underlying growth in this division. And therefore we are overall very very optimistic and positive about the outlook for Commodity Insights.Well we are not giving any particular guidance on a downside scenario in a quantitative way. So I would like to be careful to answer your question in too much specifics. I think the overall perspective that we have on the Ratings business is that at some point we will see the issuance environment coming back. We have seen this in many times in the past. At some point this will improve. And we really think that we should lower the level of anxiety around all of this because there is uncertainty around timing. But ultimately we have always said there could be one or a few quarters where Ratings revenue will be under pressure. But if you are having a mid- to long-term perspective of the company nothing has changed with respect to outstanding debt. Nothing has changed with respect to overall trends and correlations with GDP and other growth drivers. So the secular trends in this business are still there. Maybe short-term there could be some fluctuations. But if the perspective is more mid to long-term I think nothing is different with respect to the overall activity of the markets and also the economics of the business both the top line growth and the margin expectations for the Ratings business.Faiza.,0.003499338,0.005183041,0.000753189
51,51,UNP,Fritz:,And support the guidance that you gave overall which is a 55x for the year.Thank you.Yes. Jordan thanks for asking that question. So unequivocally PSR has been a benefit to the railroad even in our current environment. Letâ€™s go back to what it means. It means we try to touch cars the fewest amount of time necessary to satisfy demand for our customers and the customer need. So we donâ€™t do waste work. That by itself allows us to have excess capacity in both the terminals and in our line of road that we can use for other purposes. We also try to deconstruct our specialized networks where that makes sense so that we can have shared trains that are advancing cars more rapidly than it would otherwise. Unequivocally when you look even at the way weâ€™re operating right now when we have gotten into trouble prior to PSR our operation would be worse demonstrably worse. And weâ€™ve proven through the last 3 years that when we get into trouble in the PSR environment we can get out of trouble more readily. Now whatâ€™s happening right now is Iâ€™ll blame it on us. Shame on us we got to a place where we did not have the crew availability for when something went wrong to be able to over resource for a short period of time and get it out of the network. And thatâ€™s a tough â€“ itâ€™s not a lesson. Itâ€™s a tough situation to be in because weâ€™ve already learned that lesson. So as we look forward what we have to do is make sure that our business planning processes for resources are rock solid and that we do a better job of making sure that our network and our resources and our plan is tightly coordinated with customers and their need and get them matched up and match them up over a time frame that is the same as how we can add resources for growth. So yes unequivocally PSR is remaining the way to go. It is helping us manage the business right now and thatâ€™s not why we got into trouble.Yes.Well and Jennifer we also just need to circle back. There is one other predicate on that and that is we are improving the service product through the quarter and through the back half of the year.Yes.Yes Amit I donâ€™t think it changes fundamentally our strategy in the domestic intermodal world. The BNSF and J.B. Hunt have always been formidable competitors. And what weâ€™ve done by adding Knight Swift and Schneider along with having XPO and our long-term partner hub working with us is weâ€™ve got channel partners that can grow very effectively against that. And when you combine that with our EMP and UMAX program for some of the smaller and midsized IMCs we are fielding a really talented very compelling story for BCOs to use us. It is no surprise that our primary competitor in BNSF and their primary partner in Hunt are doubling down on how they approach the market. And candidly that kind of competition between us our channel partners and them and their channel partners is fantastic for the users for the customers of domestic intermodal.Yes Kenny do you want to handle that?And Kenny I want to brag on your team for a moment. Youâ€™re doing really tremendous work on business development on pure business development the singles and doubles where we bring on a customer we grow with an existing customer through service enhancement and enhancing the overall customer experience. Even in the context of the service issues that weâ€™re facing right now from a service product perspective behind the scenes the overall customer experience we continued to invest in that and continue to make progress.Yes.Kenny why donâ€™t you handle the back half domestic intermodal question and Iâ€™ll get to the STB after youâ€™re done.Yes. And as we improve the service product Kenny get that reliable weâ€™re in great position to take more trucks off the highway. It just makes all the sense in the world including an ESG perspective. Ravi your question on the STB hearing clearly the entire rail industry is in a place where weâ€™re as a collective not providing the kind of service that our customers demand. The STB appropriately is hearing from customers and want to talk about it. Thatâ€™s what next week is all about. Weâ€™re well prepared for those conversations and to share with the STB how weâ€™re investing and planning to continue to improve and recover and then be stable going forward and reliable and consistent. And I think thatâ€™s going to be a great opportunity to have that discussion. Weâ€™re going to encourage the STB not to make rush or knee-jerk decisions in this environment. There are some things on their docket that I would guess I would imagine somebody will advocate as solutions. And that from our perspective this is all about getting our labor right getting utilization right making sure the other resources are ready and then executing. Itâ€™s not much more complex than that right now.Yes. Thank you.Yes Walter we take a great exception to anyone that points at our historic track record and says we are under investing in our railroad right when you spend $3 billion $4 billion a year thatâ€™s not under-investing. And look at the statistics look at the facts. You go back 4 years or 5 years we would have 800 or 900 trains on our network at any given time. Today we are overloaded by plan at 700. That number should really be 600. And our network has had incremental investment put into it. Thatâ€™s what I mean by making sure we have excess resources. We have done that through the implementation of PSR in terms of we have excess terminal capacity that we can use by having mothballed certain terminals that we no longer needed in the T-plan. We have got plenty of line-of-road capacity that we can use and we continue to invest there so that we can continue to grow out efficiency safety productivity and growth in targeted areas. So when I am talking like that I am really talking about the more fungible resources like crews and locomotives. And locomotives were in great shape right. We have a strategy where we have at-the-ready locomotives positioned around the network so that we can fire them up when they are needed and then put them back once we have gotten out of the situation. So itâ€™s really â€“ to your point Walter itâ€™s really back down to crews. Historically we have had boards alternative work and training service boards where we would be able to have people not going to furlough but go into kind of a quasi status where they are still getting paid they are still getting resources from us their benefits package in its entirety. And that allows us to call them back more quickly if something happens in a demand profile that we didnâ€™t expect. We need to get back to a place where we have got those kinds of resources available to us and we are looking at all of those. But job one that we talked about first and foremost is making sure we get crew utilization and crew availability and total crewing right so that we can handle the volume we have got in front of us and the growth thatâ€™s coming.Walter I am an optimist and I am hopeful that the facts which support what I just talked about speak to the STB. And we are effective at communicating that.Yes. Thank you.Kenny do you want to handle that?I would guess Kenny given the growth that we are seeing first through Knight-Swift then with Schneider and the continued growth of Hub itâ€™s probably fair to say the ratio of privates versus EMP UMAX on us grows towards the private side.Well why donâ€™t I start with the back half of that question Brian and then I will turn it over to Eric on the front half in terms of some of the bumps in the night that you are planning for that you are mitigating. So in terms of how to be more resilient and robust there is a lot to that question. Some of it is our direct control. Some of it has to be in partnership with our customers. So whatâ€™s in our direct control we have to make sure that our jobs are more flexible and more attractive and easier to hire into. So one thing that we are in the middle of right now as an industry is trying to get to a place where two people in the cab or a locomotive are not mandated and negotiate with our union partners on moving one of those people onto the ground. That doesnâ€™t sound like much but that one person on the ground can turn into a shift job and stay at home as they are doing their work. Thatâ€™s a huge lifestyle benefit to that person as opposed to going over the road staying away from home and then coming back and being called at potentially all hours of the day. So that â€“ itâ€™s not obvious how that connects back into being more reliable more resilient more consistent but there is an obvious connection from our perspective. There is other things like that that are smaller that we need to do. I talked about oughts and getting back to a place where we have not excess manpower sitting around but our labor force our craft professionals are more flexible to go to where the work is and do the work when itâ€™s needed and still have an enhancement in their work-life balance. So there is a lot of work that we have to do with our unions on property and negotiation and national in negotiation and then just in how we design our boards and our team plan and our work overall. Eric do you want to handle that first part?Yes. Brian I would just reiterate what our concerns are. It really boils down to three things that we think we need remedies for. The first is for our customers to continue to enjoy the kind of access they have to and from Mexico we need certainty on price thatâ€™s competitive from the border into Mexico. We think about that like prop rates. Second we need to maintain what we have today with the KCS and that is fair treatment equal treatment at the border crossings on the bridge. And third the KCS and CP have talked about a significant spike in converting truck to train and moving it on our trackage rights through Houston. Houston is a congested area. Itâ€™s a â€“ itâ€™s not congested in a bad way. Itâ€™s a high-volume area that requires a lot of attention. If you introduce another 8 or 10 trains a day into that network in a rapid period without having the capital in place first it will tilt Houston and we canâ€™t accept that. So we want to make sure that if they are going to execute that plan and itâ€™s going to increase the amount of train traffic through Houston the capital is spent in advance so it doesnâ€™t crater Houston as a result.Yes. Thank you.Yes. Thank you Allison. Kenny do you want to take that?Let me start and then I want to turn it over to Eric and Kenny to kind of add a bit more detail. But I want to Jason focus in on the partner side with railroad what we need to depend on so that the network doesnâ€™t get overwhelmed. I am in part in agreement with you that we are not yet in a place where labor and distribution centers and warehouses and dray truck companies is at a place where it could take an onslaught of significant volume in the international intermodal space. So that we still need more hiring and more labor available in local truck companies and dray companies and in distribution centers. But Kenny and Eric what about us?Thatâ€™s fair.Thatâ€™s hard to nail down and give you a number right now. All I would say is we are concerned and deeply engaged with the STB to help them understand what reciprocal switching â€“ we will call it forced open access could do and what it couldnâ€™t do. It is not a wholesale remedy to for instance remedy fix current supply chain problems right. What forced open access would do is we put switching in places where it isnâ€™t right now. It would increase dwell time on freight cars. And those are two things that we absolutely donâ€™t need. Now thatâ€™s not to say that there can be a circumstance where it might make sense for somebody and it already does exist in very limited areas where we have agreed with other railroads that a reciprocal switch is needed or where the STB has mandated it through conditions on previous transactions. So we continue to work with the STB to help them understand our concerns what â€“ how it could help how it couldnâ€™t help and then get to a place where if there is action taken itâ€™s sensible.And Kenny in that context the heat of that market doesnâ€™t look like it did the last super strong cycle we had in places like the Permian and the Eagle Ford. There seems to be a little bit more discipline on capital spending and they are slower in walking up production.Thank you Jeff.Alright. Thank you Cherilyn.Alright. Thank you Rob and thank you all for engaging with us this morning and for your questions. We are looking forward to talking with you again in July to discuss our second quarter results. Until then take care.,0.002747665,0.002991259,0.000139392
52,52,INTU,Goodarzi:,Yeah. We are really excited about just the possibilities of what we can do for members -- Credit Karma members and TurboTax customers. Last year really was a learning year and I think we're going to learn a lot more this year. Listen our goal is we want every TurboTax customer to be using Credit Karma and all the benefits of Credit Karma and we want every Credit Karma member to be using TurboTax whether they want to do it themselves or they need assistance. I think we're going to be one year better than we were last year in terms of all of our experiences in terms of just the investments that we've made and the experiences and we're excited about it. But just to put it in context at Investor Day we shared with you our Horizon framework. Horizon 1 being sort of revenue impact within 0 months to 18 months Horizon 2 being 18 months to 36 months and Horizon 3 being 36 months plus. We actually put the impact of Credit Karma integrated as part of TurboTax and vice versa is almost 3 years out because we really want to nail the experience. But nevertheless we're leaning in and we're excited about the things we're going to be launching in the weeks to come.You are very welcome.Yeah Michael. Thank you for your kind words and great question. When we declared our bet around connecting people to experts and creating our virtual expert platform we have been I think we're onto now I don't know 5 plus years really investing in this virtual expert platform. There are so many underlying technologies services where AI is being used to ensure that the platform matches the right customer to the right experts to make the platform simple and easy-to-use for experts and we feel really confident relative to just the where we are with the virtual expert platform and our focus intentionally has been really about serving customers when it comes to tax time and helping small businesses with the bookkeeping and eventually also with their taxes. But more importantly just helping them run their business. And we have so much opportunity ahead of us just in that space. With that said we do have a few what we call small mission-based genes that are exploring other spaces because we can leverage a lot of the capabilities of this virtual expert platform to serve spaces like marketing potentially spaces like financial services. So we are doing experiments but very intentionally to ensure that we can learn. I think I will just end with the opportunities of where we can take this virtual expert platform is endless. However the biggest growth opportunity ahead of us right now is helping customers with taxes and helping small businesses run their business. And then as these other -- our verticals become reality we'll of course share our plans with all of you. But it is something that will extend over time horizontally continue verticals.Yeah Brad. Thank you for your kind words and the question. I would -- I'll say 2 things. 1. Really the majority of our growth continues to come from customer growth and mix in a much lesser extent price so you should just be aware of that and 2. There's nothing that we've seen from the price increase that's outside of the balance of what we expected. So the short answer is no. It's within our control limit as we expected it based on the testing that we had done.Yeah you know the -- well first of all we've not divulged our traction other than I would tell you. We generally are excited. As part of many things that we are providing in our portfolio to customers giving them early access to wages I think a lot of what we are learning and a lot of what we're excited about as we move forward. It depends on the customer and the cohort of customers. There are certain customers that depending on their situation and how much they depend on living weekly -- connected to their weekly paycheck. If you live paycheck to paycheck you are much more focused on can I get early access to that versus if you don't live week-to-week. So we're learning about those cohorts within our payroll to your question and where we can get traction and where it's just not a need for customers. I would say more broadly we are excited about early access to wages both providing it across payroll standalone providing it through Credit Karma. And frankly I think over time this is just something that's going to be commodity. I think everybody is going to have a product feature that gives you early access to the wages. For us it's not just about the feature it's about the ecosystem effect that it creates for our customers and our members.Yeah. Thank you.Yes absolutely Brent. One of the things that we -- one of our mechanisms that we have as a Company is called our Big Bet review where we take our officers of the Company through the experiences of each of the Big Bets to what we've learned where we are and where we're headed. And this is the last Big Bet review happened to be one where we brought in Ben as a team from Mailchimp and actually walked through the experience in detail where we are and where we're going. And I would just tell you that we continue to even get more excited as we've closed the deal because the needs of our customers are in all the areas that you mentioned. They are -- and every customer it's in a different place but customers are really looking for ways to be able to engage getting new customers. It's their bread and butter. Almost 70% of our customers are looking for ways to get new customers. We now have those capabilities and we'll integrate it into QuickBooks and vice versa QuickBooks into Mailchimp. They want to be able to manage their existing customers in an automated way in an insightful way where everything is automated. They don't have to know when do I follow up with a customer what additional products can I sell them. All of that can get automated through Mailchimp. And one of the things people don't realize is one of the largest ways that you still engage customers we see it through what we do in TurboTax is actually email. So now we have all those capabilities. We have abilities to put you on mega platforms with all of our digital assets manage all of your existing relationships all the email capabilities but more importantly it's the leveraging the power of the data the customer data and the purchase data to help you understand who is the customer who bought what what did they not buy who's leading your shopping card and how do you pursue them. It's consistent with what we've talked about before. That's the opportunity ahead and that's about the work that we do now on the product to put the power of those capabilities in the hands of our customers. We couldn't be more excited to help our customers with their success. So stay tuned.Yeah it's a great question. It's one thing that's just really excites us about the Live platform. 1. There's 88 million folks that use an assisted method today. Within the assisted method you have 10 million folks every year where there's churn they go -- jump from one assisted method to another. So from 1 accountant to another or from 1 store to an accountant. And then within the TurboTax base the do-it yourself or as we have 4 million people that leave and they ultimately go to an assisted method. I think that the answer to your question is it's all the above. We've seen conversion improvements retention improvements. We've seen TurboTax customers that did it themselves a year before where they had a life change or they just weren't sure if they did their home deductions the right way or if they had a kid and the kid went to college how that ultimately account for those deductions where they are now using the live platform and vice versa. You may use the life platform and I've enough confidence with the year after you do it yourself and then you may then after that bounce back and now we're seeing 3 4 years of trends. Really it's all of the above with the largest I would say driver being folks that use a different assisted method coming onto a platform and of course those that have life changes within TurboTax growing with TurboTax and using the live platform. And we just see that continuing as we view this opportunity with a 10-year lens.One of the sorts of essential strategic principles that we have within Credit Karma is that it is an agnostic platform. And our financial institutions and all our partners see the power of that how diligent and intentional we are about not creating our own products but ensuring that we match members with a product that's right for them. And a lot of the capabilities that we have within Credit Karma ultimately had an institution that's participating in it. So that is not a concern that we have. Our say due is very very high with financial institutions and we just believe that that's the beginning of it especially with attraction of Lightbox which actually delivers more success for members and more success for financial institutions. So it is not a concern of ours.Yeah. You're welcome.Kash thank you 1 for your kind comment and it's a wonderful question on all those areas the labor shortage some of the supply chain challenges if you're a product-based business and certainly inflation is absolutely impacting small businesses. I would make a broad comment that I would say we are experiencing. When you couple what happened with the pandemic starting in March of 2020 where it really I think forced everyone around the globe whether you're a small business or not but let's stay focused on small businesses to reinvent yourself. And it really accelerated the shift to virtual solutions. It accelerated the shift to going online whether it's how you invoice get paid how you do your payroll how you do your time tracking. And I think that movement which is just simply continuing I don't think wherever going to go back to the old way. I think this pandemic really has accelerated the shift in those areas that I mentioned in particular to of course to digital money offering. I think that coupled with this not only labor shortage but also labor movements from job to job some of the supply chain challenges that generally we believe as I talked to my peers will get -- start to get addressed by the second half of 2022 first half of 2023 an inflation is actually causing small businesses to leverage more platforms. And so if I then bring that back to our platform and the fact that if you use our platform you can get paid upfront you can get instant deposit you can do same-day payroll you can use an expert to ensure that you've got the best deductions as a small business and to ensure that you're running your business effectively and the fact that you can do more with less people if you use one platform. That's where the power of Mailchimp comes into play rather than having multiple tools where you're bouncing back and forth between tools and you're not really sure what your customer profitability is when you should follow up with the customer how to acquire more customers. All of those things are thrust to the use of our platform and our platform is actually built to help you grow your business with less focus on labor and to be able to embrace as much as possible the inflation. Now ultimately we have to address overtime and I believe it will get address some of these supply chain issues and inflationary issues. But that's where our platform comes into play and why we are so well-positioned for small businesses and the role we need to play to continue to educate them.Thank you Brad. I would say 2 big things. One is a full service absolutely has a halo impact on confidence for the customer which actually gets me to the second point and really the approach which is we're a platform for our customers and so really if you think customer [Indiscernible] we want our customers to know that they have the ability to do it themselves. They can access an expert if they need the expert to answer any questions that they have and/or they can just have you -- us do their taxes for them and do everything digitally. By the way midstream if you choose an expert and utilize you know what? I don't know if I just want to help I just want to Intuit to do it all for me we'll do it all for you. So really our approach and now that we've had several years of experimenting and learning with full service is that now we have a true end-to-end platform where we can meet the needs of any customer and the power has actually grown with customers over time. If they just start out their career or if they're students who they have life change we have a platform that will meet all of their needs. So that's really the I would say the headlines of the answers plays a halo effect which has informed our platform approach as we look ahead.Sure. I would really put last year entirely in the bucket of just learning. And it doesn't mean that's going to change this year. We are a Company that's all about moving fast experimenting pivoting and learning all in context of being stubborn around the vision that we have. Last year was a learning year although there were some nice member growth impacts to Credit Karma from TurboTax. We're really excited and eager to see how our new innovations and experiences on the platform plays out this year and to see what we learned. I'll take you back to the reason at Investor Day we put the opportunity of Credit Karma is part of TurboTax experience and TurboTax is part of the Credit Karma platform as a Horizon 3 is we're really focused on the customer and member experience in nailing that because we know over time we can monetize. So we're excited about the year ahead. Look we have 11 months under our belt learning and adjusting and preparing for this tax season. And we're excited about these experiences being launched and seeing how they play out in the next couple of months.You're welcome.Yeah. Sure Scott. Thank you. First up on international we saw some of the same trend given our not only our execution but the macro environment as we've seen the last couple of quarters. There are certain countries like Canada that have bounced back a bit more strongly. Then there's places like Australia that really have been very slow to bounce back based on the fact that the economy keeps opening and shutting down. And again our view is within the next year international should start to come back from a macro perspective. So net-net our trends in our performance although we're very pleased with that we believe over time to paint the different picture as the macro environment comes back. In terms of Mailchimp our focus is the 3 priorities that I mentioned. We want to create an amazing product and platform that brings QuickBooks and Mailchimp together. We want to build the capabilities to go disrupt mid-market. And then as Michelle mentioned we're going to be investing heavily in our global go-to-market. I would say I wouldn't overly anticipate a significant change in our trajectory international because of Mailchimp where there's some fundamental things we want to get right to ensure that we can truly be the platform that -- where you can grow your business and run your business and over time it will certainly have an impact internationally and we're excited about that because it gives us another foot in the door outside of the U.S.I would say and I've said this for years and I think you're used to hear Brad talk about this. I think where the world's biggest hidden secret and we don't want that secret to hold true anymore. We want to make sure the world knows who Intuit is and what our brands are. And we have data that shows that the more customers learn that TurboTax Credit Karma Mailchimp now and QuickBooks when they learn that they're part of the Intuit brand and the platforms are all connected it actually has a positive impact on our potential for growth. So the way we think about Intuit Dome it is not for us a naming rights deal. We've had many opportunities where we've actually been pursued to be part of deals like this and we pass them up over the years. We did this because one it's very technology forward dome. We're going to be helping the community. And 2. We're really going to be able to showcase our brands. And it will be yet another way to demonstrate the benefits that we bring to the market as one Intuit platform and the impact that we can have in the lives of consumers and small businesses. That's really how we think about it and why we're excited about it. And by the way over time we expected the same return on investment as we do with our marketing investments and that's really what this is. It just goes beyond marketing to impacting the local communities in LA which we're excited about.You're welcome.Yes. Sure. Thank you. Well first of all I really appreciate all the questions. And once again I want to just thank our employees for their incredible hard work our customers and our partners for the strong start to the year and the opportunity we have ahead of us. We're very passionate about fundamentally powering the prosperity of our customers and communities and we're proud of our accomplishments and we continue to believe that we are just getting started. Thanks for your question Thanks for your time and we will see you at our next earnings call. Bye everybody.,0.008132376,0.036552668,0.010790353
53,53,AMGN,Gordon:,Thanks Salveen. Maybe I'll start and then turn it over to Dave on the data question. We're obviously working extremely closely with all of the oncology providers to improve their own internal systems whereby they have that KRAS G12C status with literally fingertip ready for making treatment choices for their patients. What we are seeing is a little bit of a COVID hangover effect. Many of these large oncology networks in the U.S. are short staffed and constrained in the resources that they can deploy against things like EMR enhancements against things like better workflows for diagnostics and biomarkers particularly new biomarkers. So we are working literally account by account across the country. We've made huge improvements and we've seen some very large community oncology networks which is where 80% of the patient base is treated. They're treated in the community centers. I think in the academic institutions the testing is very strong robust. The care is clear and the test results are available for patients who progress. So it's really in the U.S. community setting where we're working. As we look ex-U.S. we see a different pattern by country. So countries that have advanced biomarker technology and very clear systems like Germany and France we expect good uptake there and we're already seeing early indicators of that. France as you may recall has an early access program called an ATU program where we can actually charge for the product and that's being used already fairly broadly. And in Germany we're just launching and a few weeks old as we are in Japan. So I think it's a network by network project that we're working intensely with our medical colleagues with our commercial teams to make sure that no patient slips through. Dave?Thanks Matthew for the question. No I don't really have a lot of new information to update you on. We continue to feel like we're extremely well positioned for the opportunity to be among the first if not the first and potentially only biosimilar for a period of time in the market in 2023 as of January 31. We like our profile competitively given that we -- as you'll recall we use the existing inflammation commercial organization that currently commercialize Enbrel and Otezla that have relationships intact with rheumatologists and dermatologists. We actually have a GI footprint as well supporting us solo. So we feel that we've got the customer relationships. We definitely have the payer relationships. We have obviously 40 years of biologics manufacturing and supplying every patient every time to provide the confidence for pharmacy benefit managers to make the decision to make our product available as early as possible. So we're excited about the opportunity. And then of course after the launch of AMGEVITA in the U.S. we have several other launches STELARA EYLEA Soliris and then additional launches thereafter. So six new biosimilars coming into the market so this is an area where we're very focused. We've invested in this area. It's important to us for our long-term growth and we have the capabilities in the market to ensure success.Thanks Peter. You're on. I would say in the U.S. what we're seeing with LUMAKRAS is when that KRAS G12C status is known at the point of progression from first-line treatment to second line. We're getting over 80% of those patients to be treated by LUMAKRAS. So we're penetrating the population when the identification of the KRAS G12C status is there. So that's clearly the lever that we need to ensure improved. And as I answered Salveen's question earlier this is really an account-by-account book of work. And we're doing it with urgency because we really can't have patients progressing from first line to second line and not have the choice of LUMAKRAS. So this is really important work that we're doing for patients. When we look at the epidemiology of disease in the U.S. versus ex-U.S. I would say that the overall incidence of non-small cell lung cancer is similar between the U.S. and Europe in terms of size. Now one thing just to think about as you go into Asia as the incidence of KRAS G12C mutational status is a bit lower. If you take Japan as an example it's about 4% of patients who have non-small cell lung cancer that also have a KRAS G12C mutation compared to 13% in the U.S. So the mutational epidemiology does change a little when you go outside of U.S. and Europe. So we would expect the business to be slightly bigger in the U.S. than it will be in Europe and rest of the world.Yes perhaps on the first question regarding patient numbers and duration of therapy. I think it's a little bit premature to be able to draw conclusions from numbers on drug versus numbers treated to get to DOT or duration of therapy. What you need to understand I guess in the 2 500 patients is we've got a combination of patients who were very late-stage disease third line and beyond potentially who were challenged with the product and didn't do very well. Whereas the steady state will be more second-line patients having experienced maybe one prior line of therapy who could do quite well as indicated by the long-term follow-up data that we just put out at AACR where you see about 1/3 of patients being alive at the two-year follow-up mark. So I think it's too early to infer from existing in-market patient numbers to understand what the effective duration of therapy will be. And in fact I often say this is you really actually need 24 months in market to understand what your look-back period is to understand what your duration of therapy is. So it's going to be quite some time before we know what our real-world duration of therapy will be.Thanks Carter on the question regarding TEZSPIRE. We're really excited about the market response to TEZSPIRE by having such a novel unique product where the profile really simplifies the treatment of severe uncontrolled asthma particularly for pulmonologists who have so much else to do that they're looking for a simple solution that can treat their patients without being limited by phenotypic or biomarker status. So overall we think it's going really well. It's clearly a benefit to have a permanent J-code in the market which as I mentioned will be coming July 1. That gives confidence to providers and to their billing staff that they can code the product appropriately and have a high degree of assurance on reimbursement. I think they know the reimbursement is happening now but it's also tied to reimbursement for some of these practices. Some of them run pretty tight cash flows. And knowing that the permanent J-code should expedite the time to reimbursement will actually help. So yes I'd say it's going to be helpful. But I would say the in-market response currently is really good. And we're clearly providing product to patients who are going through that reimbursement step in that process so that they can get on therapy and have access to the medicine. But yes we'd be looking for additional sales force -- sales growth in the back half of the year.Thanks Robin. We are pleased with the evolution of Repatha. The growth is actually fairly consistent across the broad cardiology community. So it's not just your podologist a variety of cardiologists. We're seeing general community cardiologists. We also have a large effort focused on integrated delivery networks and hospital systems where we have been successful in establishing a more standardized way of treating the some 25 million high-risk ASCVD patients in the U.S. that end up in an acute care facility for their MI or other events that they've been admitted for. And unfortunately many of them don't even get a lipid panel and many of them get discharged without appropriate recommendations or initiation of treatment. So we've stepped that up quite a bit and we're seeing improvements quality of care. And those patients are being discharged then to the community cardiologists and/or primary care physicians with clearer intent on more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy or cardiovascular risk reduction. So that's definitely helping. For future growth we're obviously going to continue that effort and we're going to continue to expand that IDN work that we're going to do in the U.S. but we're also going to invest incrementally in primary care given that we're seeing some spontaneous prescribing with primary care. So we're very pleased with the growth of Repatha. Ex-U.S. the other thing I would mention is we got the Jan 1 listing for Repatha in the China National Reimbursement Drug List which has been a good launch for us there. And our team in China is doing a nice job of ensuring that Repatha is an option for high-risk ASCVD patients in that country. So really I think we've got a large amount of headroom for growth on this product. there's a large patient population and we've got good momentum now in cardiology and we need to continue to build that into primary care and around the world. With respect to inclisiran obviously they're a competitor in the market. But given that they don't yet have event reduction data even with reimbursement coding I think they're still limited in what they can promote. But again there's tons of patients out there that need more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy and more aggressive cardiovascular risk reduction and we see that the market can bear a lot of people talking about this severe disease the number one killer in the world for everybody that's concerned about patients and what we can do about it. So overall we're still very bullish.Thanks Mohit. Unfortunately because severe asthma especially uncontrolled severe asthma is such an acute condition many of these patients are under frequent care of a pulmonologists that are an allergist. And so they're seeing their physician on a very regular basis. And I think given our very convenient once month dosing it's seen as a fairly easy product to administer. And of course it's early days in the launch but the feedback has been that the physician administration is not a barrier to initiation of TEZSPIRE. And allergists in particular are used to physician-administered products. What I think the benefit side of this is really playing out is that they have much less work to do on the biomarker side or the phenotypic assessment side. And so we've simplified their workflow in that regard. I do think over the long haul we'll continue to evaluate what we need to do to ensure that there's convenience and maintenance for patients. And obviously we're looking at other indications and other life cycle opportunities for test buyer. So we'll continue to assess whether or not we want to provide a self-administered option. I mean clearly the product could be developed that way and we continue to look at that.Yes it's a pretty detailed hypothetical. What I would say is first off we remain confident that the 960-milligram dose is the right dose. And clearly the safety and efficacy benefit of that product looks very good. And given the long-term follow-up data clearly it's a high bar for us to be able to see if it can be approved upon at a lower dose. So that's the one question that remains to be answered. The way I guess I can't directly answer your question because there's so many different complicated variables to it. But what I would say is we continue to look at the best way to provide the right treatment for continuing patients. So if you're a second-line non-small cell lung cancer patient you've been prescribed LUMAKRAS at 960. You're taking it you've responded and you're stable. I'm not sure any oncologist is going to want to lower your dose if you're a continuing patient. Now we've seen that in other disease areas where there might have been a dose change either to go up or to go down where patients who are on a stable dose usually stay on that. So that would be my one bit of additional commentary to your question. But we'll wait and we'll see the data and we'll handle it according to what the data say and what the FDA guys us to do.Thanks for the question Evan. No we're really pleased with the response from payers and PBMs to ensuring that the expanded label now regardless of severity of psoriasis the patients can have strong access and good affordability for the product. In fact we've actually improved access this year versus last year. So we've been able to produce some of the prior authorization criteria things like percentage of body surface area. There are there are some medical policies of prior authorizations where that's described as a percentage. We've had many of those removed. So we've actually opened up access for those patients. And I think that year to prescribe Otezla for that milder patient. I was at the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in March and spoke to many dermatologists and asked them what their prescribing experience was like and what the reimbursement experience was. And I think many of them played back to us that Otezla was easier than it had been in the past to prescribe for that milder patient. The other thing we did was we enhanced our co-pay systems and our own bridging programs to ensure that that launch would go well. So far so good off to a good start but I don't anticipate access being an impediment.,0.010285397,0.043409526,0.014828867
54,54,IBM,Murphy:,Okay. Amit thanks for the question. Letâ€™s go to the next one please?Okay. Thanks Toni. Letâ€™s go to the next question?Thanks Erik. Sheila letâ€™s go to the next question please?Thanks Kyle. Letâ€™s go to the next question please?Thanks Brian. Sheila letâ€™s go to the next question?Thanks David. Sheila letâ€™s take one last question?Thanks. Sheila let me turn it back to you to wrap up the call.,0.002408981,0.002408981,0
55,55,BA,Calhoun:,Good morning Rob.Yes. So we always think about this in two ways. One is that that inventory opportunity I just described and we've got to work on getting those delivered. And then of course the production rate that we're essentially at 31 a month. Our biggest job right now is to stabilize around that rate. The teams are working hard. They deal with supply constraints that pop up every now and then but we got to be stable around 31 and then anything else is going to be a future decision that we're not prepared to take because we just want to get confidence in what's right in front of us. The good news is that there's plenty of demand that we can fulfill. And while we're watching the supply chain very closely we feel good about where that particular program stacks up.Yeah let me take that one. It's a very tricky question. And I don't want to speak for our counterparty in any way. Part of our 777X move out into 2025 was to incorporate exactly whatever observations that you took account of to incorporate all the learnings we've had from our cert programs the original MAX the 87 now the -7 and then the -10. So we keep trying to incorporate all our learnings and it is definitely a more rigorous process that we're all going through. Everything has to be completed. Every I has to be dotted and every T has to be crossed. And now we're all getting used to it. So on the subject of whether that's a mature process or not boy I hope so. And I believe we're all better off for it. I don't like all the difficulties we've had to go through to get here but so far so good. And I know I think the FAA has enough rigor in what they're doing. But with every next cert I think we're all going to learn that it's just going to take a little longer. It's going to be a little more thorough than it's ever been.Yeah.Yes. I don't -- I've never seen this and I have yet to run into an issue where we have not been resourced adequately on the programs. This is always boiled down to the time lines and we go through these time lines every week. So the time lines have always been impacted by the rigor of the discussion between ourselves and our counterparty the FAA on what's needed what data is required what's needed to demonstrate a certain point or to write fully the development assurance program. A lot of writing a lot of documentation very thorough et cetera. It has not been about whether we've had enough engineers to do the development work or to -- or even to write the technical work. So more focus more resources on programs is always helpful. But that's not been the constraint so far and I don't expect it to be the constraint. I think our push out on the 777X with respect to the reallocation of resources frankly the biggest beneficiary of that is going to be the traditional metal wing 777 and our ability to just run some more airplanes through that -- through the line in the midst of the demand that we're seeing. So on the reallocation question that's where I see the benefit the most. We have to really see it on the cert programs themselves.It's a great question. I hope I never get there. First and foremost with respect to the original legislation there was a lengthy window put in there based on historic certification timetables that would have provided for the seven and 10 easily. So these things have taken longer. The intent of that legislation was never to stop the derivative product line with respect to the MAX. So I believe our chances are good with respect to getting legislative relief. It doesn't mean we'll get them. And if we don't it's a problem. On the other hand demand for the MAX is substantial. And we have other airplanes and substitution that we could implement. And that decision has to get made sometime between now and the end of the year. Don't feel the need to do it now. I'm still pretty focused and our company is pretty focused on getting the -10 certified and in our customers' hands. They love everything about the airplane. That's doing incredibly well on the development program itself. So it's a good question. It's the right question and we have to make sure our decisioning and thought process is ahead of where we think things end up at the end of the year.Yes.Yes. So Ron let me start by hoping that you haven't missed the restructuring of our engineering organization. We -- it's the first thing I did. It wasn't to address the issue you're talking about because I don't attribute all of our issues and specific instances and write-offs to engineering shortfalls. I don't -- I never have. But we did restructure engineering to in effect reinforce build our safety management system in a different way with a different outlet so that people could voice concerns and call out engineering disciplines as appropriate. And it's worked and it's been fantastic. And we've benefited from the ideas that have moved from the BDS to BCA et cetera et cetera. So we've been beneficiaries of what I think is a significant restructuring. We are hiring. We are doing I think a terrific job on that front. It is not easy. So I don't want anybody to think otherwise but we have had a pretty successful hiring program a pretty successful retention program on that front. But when we look at the write-offs that we've taken let's say this quarter for instance these fixed price development contracts that we took were taken before COVID existed and before this inflationary spiral came ripping down the road. So I don't attribute that to engineering shortfalls. And I don't attribute our certification issues and time lines to engineering shortfalls in any way. Our airplanes are flying incredibly well. Our 777X made it to Dubai made it to Singapore and a gangbuster show. Everyone loved it. It's flying beautifully. It's meeting all of the requirements that we laid out. But the process of discovery between ourselves and our certification or our regulators around the world it's different. It's changed. It's got to be thorough and it's got to be good. So I don't accept the premise entirely that you put forward in the question. But please don't miss the fact that we have restructured and we are building our engineering function. I've always believed it's strong. I believe it's going to be even stronger.Yeah. So it's a great question Doug. Yeah I will have a very different philosophy with respect to fixed price development. And so I don't expect and I hope never to contribute to that issue. But we are where we are. And let me also say because I was on the Board at the time the T-7 and MQ-25 programs were taken and yes they were written off the day we took them knowing that we would be investing a fair amount of our own money in the future of those airfreight. I will tell you this. I think those are going to be really good bet even though the development costs are more than we had anticipated. When we get through them all and deliver on those contracts those airplanes don't go away. There are futures attached to them and big programs in our view that involve many many airplanes. And I think both airplanes are going to be very successful in supporting our military. So the futures with respect to real airplanes making real margins and contributing to The Boeing Company I still believe strongly in. And then I'll just -- as I think I said earlier in my CNBC interview Air Force One I'm just going to call a very unique moment a very unique negotiation a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn't have taken. But we are where we are and we're going to deliver great airplanes. And we're going to recognize the costs associated with it. With respect to inputs yes it's predominantly COVID related inefficiency because I'll remind us in the defense world when a COVID line goes down or a group of workers steps out we don't have a whole bunch of cleared people to step into their shoes. So it has always been a tougher implication. And for VC-25B where the clearances are ultra high it's really tough. So we just got whacked in a number of different areas. Where you started is a great question and one that I hope I never contribute to.Thanks.Well that's a -- it's a big question for the last one but I'm very willing to take it on. You know the circumstance under which I came into the role. It all happened in a period of weeks and I simply took on the objectives that had been set program by program inside the business. And I discussed with the Board that I would not in any way shape or form hold that compensation program hostage to what I do with The Boeing Company. I would simply do what's right. I would simply pursue the programs operate them the way I think they should be. If there are improvement opportunities that would compromise my ability to make one of those deliveries then that's what I would do. So -- and that's what I've been doing. And I have been resetting expectations every step of the way the best I can. We have certain things in the world that we can't predict that frustrates everyone. I get it. But what we do is we just keep trying to improve and get better and get back to a normalized rate of cash flow for you cash flow for us. And I'm highly confident in our ability to do that and I'm highly confident in the Boeing people to do it. So I don't want to recalibrate expectations other than timing questions and real-world stuff around how regulators approach certification. These are real. They take a little longer than they used to. They're a little more thorough than they used to. Boeing is better for it in the long run. And every one of these programs lasts for decades and decades every one of them. And that's how I think about everything I do inside The Boeing Company. I think my Board understands it and I trust that they will evaluate me on that basis whether or not compensation schemes are perfectly aligned.Thanks.,0.003161967,0.00390774,0.00045389
56,56,SBUX,Culver:,Yes Jared thanks for your question. Our pricing strategy as Kevin has shared and Rachel as well is driven by several factors such as inflation rates partner investments the infrastructure investments that we want to make and then obviously the investments we want to make on continuing the innovation pipeline. We do all those things while balancing the premium value for our customers and the experience we want to provide them. As we saw inflation begin to increase in the middle of this past year we made the decision to take pricing and we implemented pricing effective October 1. As inflation continued to grow we saw that. We needed to take additional action and we did so effective January 1. So weâ€™ve taken two moves around pricing to help mitigate the challenges that weâ€™re seeing. Now we also have additional pricing action that we have planned for the balance of the year that will additionally help offset the trends and some of the cost pressures that weâ€™re seeing. And as Kevin highlighted thatâ€™s being informed by the analytics and insight team. In terms of elasticity we have not seen any meaningful impact to customer demand. To the contrary our customer demand continues to grow. Weâ€™re coming off of a very strong quarter in terms of transaction growth at 12% for the quarter in the U.S. the highest since pre-pandemic levels and our ticket is also very strong as well. So we watch that very closely and we will adjust accordingly.Yes. Sara thanks for the question. Yes we did see an Omicron impact especially amplify in the last two to three weeks of the quarter. And it played out in a couple of ways obviously in terms of as the cases surged number one customer mobility was impacted. But then also we saw our partners also have a similar surge in the number of cases as well as call-outs which Kevin spoke to and Rachel spoke to in terms of the Omicron COVID pay or the COVID pay that we provide our partners. Now with that we also were in the midst of having a record holiday quarter and couldn't be more proud of the work that the team did in terms of delivering very strong top line growth of 23% in a very very complex environment. In terms of what we're seeing in terms of the transactions and the growth of transactions there is a pent-up demand for Starbucks and for people wanting and longing to return to their normalized routine. So a couple of things that I would just call out. First the beverage attach that we're seeing in the stores continues to normalize. We've seen strong beverage mix growth across in particular cold beverages which now account for 70% â€“ over 70% of our beverage transactions. We've also seen strength in alt-dairy and the growth of alt-dairy and then also an increase in the modifier performance whether it was the holiday beverage or the overall promotion that we saw very strong growth. Food continues to grow and break all-time records in the quarter and really that's being driven by breakfast and by bakery. The other thing I would just add is that our peak transactions improved versus the prior quarter and a year-over-year basis. And then we had strong growth on the digital side. We now surpassed 26 million 90-day active members. And as part of that our non-SR customer transactions continued to grow and reached its highest level since the pre-pandemic. In terms of the stores and where we saw traction in that the suburban and the rural stores where drive-thrus are the most prevalent continue to outpace the rest of the portfolio. Our drive-thrus had its fourth straight quarter of double-digit comp growth. The central business district the urban core and the urban edge recovery also continues and it was the third quarter in a row of positive comps for all three of those urbanities. And then the convenience channels continue to play a big role. Between MOP drive-thru and delivery that accounted for over 70% of our sales in the quarter. So very encouraged with the strong customer demand and the way in which our partners really were able to meet the needs of our customers and step up under very very challenging circumstances.Yes. This is an area John that the team is laser focused on. And clearly it starts with taking action to reduce the complexity of the work in our stores for our partners to meet the demand of our customers. And we've shared previous calls the work that we've got going on around automated ordering. That continues to be put in place to reduce those manual routines of our partners. We continue to make investments in improved functionality for our equipment and better flow-through of that equipment in terms of what it's able to produce whether that's the measuring of two machines whether that's the warming ovens or whether that's our cold brew system and then also at the same time always assessing our beverage routines ways in which we can build beverages become more effective and more productive in building those beverages and drive better productivity. And then lastly in terms of eliminating low-volume SKUs we have taken action to eliminate and reduce low-volume SKUs. We did that during the first surge of COVID where we ran into some of the supply chain challenges. We took action to pull some of the low-volume food items out of the stores and we have not had a meaningful impact to overall sales revenue. So productivity plays a key role for us going forward and it's an area that we're laser focused on.Okay. Thank you very much Lauren. As I shared we added and grew our active memberships 21% in the quarter and we now exceed 26 million active members. We added five million active 90-day members on a year-over-year basis. So Starbucks Rewards now represents 53% of the spend in our stores which is at an all-time high and which is a three-point increase versus fiscal â€“ Q1 fiscal 2021. As part of that their growth in terms of spend has grown commensurately. We're seeing significant increase in the spend in the first year of membership versus the prior 12 months of the preceding membership. We're seeing a strong lift in spend when they join regardless of whether the customer is high or low frequency. And Rewards members as you shared are spending at an elevated rate and visit our stores at a 3x frequency rate versus our nonmembers. So we're going to continue as a company to double down in this area and we see it as significant upside and presenting tremendous value to meet the need states of our customers.Yes David Iâ€™ll take that question. And clearly itâ€™s no secret that weâ€™re in a constrained labor environment broadly across the country. In particular foodservice is one of the most heavily impacted in terms of finding available labor and staffing the needs of a business. Our turnover rates I would say as we track them they were and have been elevated versus our pre-COVID levels. But what weâ€™ve done with the actions that weâ€™ve taken as we emerged out of the quarter weâ€™re beginning to see that turnover rate stabilize. And basically our hourly turnover rate has basically flattened over the course of the last several weeks. In addition to that weâ€™ve also seen a significant uptick in terms of partner sentiment which is improving as well. So for us we are an employer of choice. Weâ€™re going to continue to make the right investments in our partners whether that has to do with wage whether that has to do with benefits or just really giving them the opportunity to grow with the company. And we feel very confident that weâ€™re going to come out of this in a much stronger place given the actions that weâ€™ve taken. But clearly it is a challenging environment. Weâ€™ve had to adjust our labor models and adjust store hours to address it. And weâ€™ve been able to navigate it thus far and we have confidence that weâ€™ll continue to be able to navigate that.Yes John just as it relates to the transactions that you mentioned we are focused on getting back to those levels. A couple of things that are impacting it is obviously the way in which our stores are set up and how customers are being mobile or not going to work and not having their normal routines. Now we did see on the good side a positive side return of the breakfast daypart and peak transactions which gives us optimism for hope in terms of growing those transactions during that period. In addition I would say that weâ€™re going to continue to leverage the convenience channels of Mobile Order & Pay as well as drive-through and delivery to meet the changing customer needs to drive transaction growth going forward as well. And then lastly I would say that we will continue to assess the store footprint to make sure that we are building new stores and relocating additional stores â€“ existing stores into the areas where customers are given the pandemic and the changes that have occurred in the pandemic. And Starbucks Rewards is going to play a significant role in that as part of that growth.Yes. I think that what we see â€“ well I know what weâ€™ve seen is that as weâ€™ve had to adjust store operating protocols in some cases weâ€™ve gone to pickup-only weâ€™ve gone to drive-thru-only and weâ€™ve readjusted the format. So the ability for customers to come into the stores and to sit in the store is not at the level of capacity than it was back prior to COVID. This is an area that weâ€™re continuing to focus on in adjusting and reopening the stores fully number one as weâ€™re able to given COVID and number two as weâ€™re able to given some of the staffing challenges that weâ€™ve seen. So we continue to adjust and monitor this very closely and make decisions on a daily basis. Now in terms of customers and their changing routines and how much is going to go back to where it was before and how much has changed we feel confident that given the Starbucks Experience our customers come to us because they love a great premium experience in a high quality cup of coffee. And whether it is coming in our stores or coming through the convenience channels weâ€™re going to continue to grow in all those areas and meet the change whatever it is for our customers going forward in terms of their routines.,0.003461373,0.004790723,0.000740395
57,57,AMAT,Halliday:,Sure. Well you've got a couple of questions in there Harlan. Mechanically what we do? Two the visibility. And three what do we think unconstrained demand is in 2022? So if you think about how we do it we send signals to the supply chain through MRP. And they say they can meet or not meet. Frankly they are struggling to understand what they can meet more than a quarter or two out because it's their suppliers right? So I think visibility is kind of gray. So we mechanically do it but nobody is sure right? The second thing is -- but we see improvement right? The second thing is what do we think unconstrained demand is? I think the tactical question you asked too could we go out of the year with demand still north of supply? Yes we could. We're into 2023. So I think our backlog probably grows throughout our fiscal year. If you go look at unconstrained demand I think WFE 100 billion is defined as what we ship for the industry. And you see our competitors are also constrained this year and they're booking into 2023. I think unconstrained demand is several billion more than 100. I think it's less than 110 billion but it's more than 100 billion.Youâ€™re welcome.That mostly helps efficiency of shipping receiving moving things around. It doesn't do much to our costs because our volumes are up so the cost that we absorb into the burden. And so as a percentage of cost it doesn't have much impact. We probably frankly will do further expansions in the next year or two. But I don't think it hurts our cost helps our -- affect us in efficiency.Yes I think gross margin is probably about 0.5 point from the Q2 guide to Q4. And I think what we just mentioned doesn't have really any impact.Sure. It's a good question Tim. I think the 14% 15% is running a little higher. I think sustainably you're at a good 15%. If you look at the trend lines and just split it out WFE intensity just WFE divided by customers' revenues if you look at FoundryLogic DRAM and NAND FoundryLogic is the most and it's trending up for a couple of reasons leading edge and because of there's not enough tools for the trailing edge. So the revenue dollars take more WFE and you can sort of see customers talking about that too. And you see customers like TI who haven't spent in years having to add trailing capacity so the CapEx as a percentage of WFE of revenues trending up. If you do a rough cut and you think with this FoundryLogic mix with more ICAPS with more greenfields and technological inflections around 3D and gate-all-around which will drive a little more spending I think 15% is kind of new normal frankly. If you look at electronics spending in 2025 it's about $780 billion. So if you take 15% of that you're about $117 billion WFE in 2025. So I think kind of sustainable growth rate is high single digits for WFE and it's driven partly -- and half of that has got a capital intensity half is growth in wafer starts. And if you drive the capital intensity at 50% I think the numbers all kind of worked to high single-digit sustainable cross-cycle growth rate for WFE.What were the two choices again Mehdi?All right. So what we did is we broke down ICAPS a little bit. We define ICAPS as everything except the leading node. So that's 10 and above okay? But then I drove into it some more and I said I want to look at 20-nanometer and above including 200-millimeter stuff because if you look at the last three years the sales in those have grown. Now where you particularly had growth is 28-nanometer stuff. So the percentage of foundry and logic that was 20-nanometer and above in 2020 in the WFE numbers was 31%. And then our revenue mix for us for foundry-logic pretty similar too. We had 43% for 2021 and 44% for 2022. And where you see the biggest growth year-on-year is 28-nanometers up; 45-nanometers up the strongest; 90-nanometer not too much. But we went into depth by node by year. So our conclusion is that -- so the other thing that's interesting Mehdi was it's gone up the rate of acceleration has diminished somewhat. And then if you look at a curve in the out years for ICAPS leading edge DRAM and NAND and their share and growing of WFE you see ICAPS growing in absolute volume. So what also you have to think about is where do the ICAPS tools come from? Not only are the number of devices coming but we did get the equipment for that. So they used to take that equipment and roll it over from the leading edge. So let's make up an example. So in the leading edge you might run it for a couple of years two nodes and you might roll 90% of the equipment forward to the next node and then 10% for reuse of some gets left behind. But if ICAPS trailing edge isn't growing much you have most of your equipment for the trailing edge fully depreciated to use on the trailing edge. But an incremental growth in ICAPS they believe your ICAPS grows 2x. Your capital equipment requirements for it goes up like 10x relatively speaking because you don't have that much equipment rolling over from the leading edge. So the WFE spend on ICAPS is driven by not just growth in ICAPS but the availability of tools to roll into it that generally have to buy new.Yes. I think that's fair. The only thing you might look at Mehdi which is interesting is where is the growth in WFE spend by application. And you've got a pretty big growth in the out years for automobiles IoTs some of the sensors stuff in phones. So I agree the China stuff will sustain stuff. I agree that the long-term demand is pretty good. I agree that they can't keep growing forever. But I think it's already started to decelerate a little bit in the relative growth rates from 2020 to 2021 2021 to 2022. And you have to look at that availability of tools to roll over from the leading edge when you look at WFE because it's a compounding factor.You're welcome.Sure Mike. I'll give you my three-legged stool summary. You all look forward to those. Number one demand continues to be very strong. We see our business trending up as we proceed through the year and we believe 2023 will be even stronger. Number two Applied's position is very strong. I'm confident that we really make progress with our supply chain; we'll be able to demonstrate that we are very much on track to our market share and our gross margin targets. And number three even in this constrained environment we're generating record revenue and operating cash flow which is fueling strong shareholder returns. Now Mike let's go ahead and close the call.,0.002685726,0.002853811,0.000156056
58,58,ISRG,Guthart:,Yes. It's a good question. The -- what I'd say here is a couple. One is as the technologies have matured and the installed base has gotten bigger we've made an intentional decision to invest a lot in upgrading the capabilities of Gen 4 platforms that are out there. So the first thing has been that the SI that somebody purchases today is more capable than the SI that they had in -- when it was first launched and we keep doing that. In part that's easier those kind of incremental adds to platform architecture that's pretty mature are easier for the customer base to absorb. And they also compound utilization. They allow them to get more utility out of the capital they have. They get higher throughput through it and they do more procedures with it. And in Gen 4 we're not done with that. We have continued to do it and whether it's instruments and accessories or endoscopy or software. And we have some things up our sleeves for that too. So that was intentional. We were doing more kind of structural changes early on in that product and we have intentionally moved some things into more incremental changes on Gen 4. We do think that there are bigger structural changes that will make sense. We are working on them. They are interesting. I think they have long-term implications for the surgical market segments we participated and I'm excited about them. Some of those things are around technology development. Some of them are around manufacturing and supply chain development and some of them are around clinical pathways and regulatory pathways. So all of those things play out. I will reinforce what you said. We work on incremental changes. We work on structural changes and we work kind of multiple generations ahead and that remains true. We continue to do that. Timing-wise sometimes a little bit hard to predict perfectly based on both supply chain readiness and how FDA thinks about those things. For us I want to make sure that every time we make a step that the customers value it that it's done with them in mind rather than with us in mind. And we continue to have that philosophy and we'll pursue it.Thanks Rick. On submission for Europe the -- we just submitted our dossier. Europe has changed over their -- the framing of their medical device regulation. They call it EU MDR. It's relatively new for the world. As a result projecting exact timing to get those clearances is a little different relative to historical norms. We don't anticipate it completing in 2022. That's just -- it's a little bit of what's the odds game but we think it's several quarters to finish mostly because it's new for the regulators and it's new for us. On the point of how is Ion ongoing it's being driven right now on the single indication of biopsy and bronchoscopy. I think it's driving well because it meets a need. I think alternate technologies manual and robotic are less capable. And we see a lot of peer-to-peer word of mouth that is driving interest and that's backed by data like the PRECIsE trial. So that's been helpful for us. A lot of our focus here has been developing our manufacturing capacity continuously improving the product in terms of usability quality robustness and efficacy. And the teams are doing a great job and working extremely hard to do all of those things make sure that we can maintain supply and improve. I'm just delighted with what they're up to. They are both increasing capacity and improving robustness and quality simultaneously. So that's been wonderful and I think we have room. We're seeing the combination of Ion bronchoscopic evaluation combined with robotic surgery thereafter sometimes people do it on the same day. And that has seen some real value for patients. It's not every part of the patient population but there are some patients for whom that's a good solution. And we see a lot of excitement. So the tie-through of Ion diagnostics with follow-through treatment is creating patient value. It's shortening the time to definitive answers and then a surgery if a surgery is indicated. So that's been great. We think Ion as a platform has multiple future indications that it can provide clinical value that it can bring and we are pursuing them assertively in various places. We are not yet publicly describing what those things are in part because we have some technology to develop in part there's some regulatory pathways in and it's a competitive space. And so we're working down those elements. As we get a little closer have a little bit better visibility into which ones when then we'll be sure to share.There's absolutely a relationship between procedure growth and demand and increased utilization on capital right? And it's inversely related. If you have lower utilization you sell more capital to do the same number of procedures. We have believed and have pursued assertively that while higher utilization decreases the number of systems that we sell it increases the utility the economic value derived by our customers to get higher throughput. And so we put programs in both in terms of design and workflow as well as consulting services to help them get higher utilization. We've been doing that for years. It's a number that you can move in a sustained way but it's hard to move quickly. And I'll turn it over to Jamie shortly who'll talk a little bit about what the trend line and utilization growth has been. But from an intent point of view we are happy to see increased utilization even if that pressures near-term capital because it creates better ROI conditions for our customers. And from a pure marginal economics point of view at Intuitive the marginal economics work out well for us too. So it's a win-win even though at the top line in placements it may look like pressure. So then you had asked the question kind of what is peak utilization and how do you think about that. I'll also turn it over to Jamie. It has a lot to do with mix and operating conditions in the hospital. It's a little bit less a technology question a little bit more how they use it. So Jamie perhaps a little bit on utilization.Thanks Rick.I'll turn those both to Jamie.In general if the quotaâ€¦If the quota is responsive to demand we think demand is high and the question is how responsive to that demand is the central government quota when they do it. Sorry Larry go ahead.The -- I won't speak to the quantitative approach. And perhaps Jamie you have a perspective. But just to give you a little bit of a qualitative view many of the hospitals out there that are greenfields while they may not have one of our programs today are part of an integrated delivery network that somewhere in the system they have our products and knowledge. The way we work with that is collaboratively with IDN leadership. As they start to understand what the value of the programs are they will start to move within their own system our products into locations they care about. And so we've seen a really nice move and collaborative expansion with our customer base into those spaces. Increasingly we have conversations about moving into different sites of care especially as benign -- general surgery procedures and some other procedures that are benign and often done in smaller ambulatory environments become more prevalent in our workspace we see that improving over time. So we think we can follow our customers where they want to go. There is the concentrating effect of robotics and capital investment. It is capital investment. When that happens it does concentrate regionally those patients and procedures into Centers of Excellence. We think that's good for our customer to get higher utilization. We think it's good for surgical outcomes because they get more practice. So I think it's a combination of the two. I don't think we just look at it and think we have to go to where every patient is today. We do think consolidation helps and works but it will expand from where it is in this moment. Jamie I don't know if you want to add anything to that.Drew I'll give you a fast follow-up here at the end.A little color on that. I think over the mid-term we're really excited about it. Over the near term it takes more. Thank you Drew. That was our last question.In closing we continue to believe there's a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals physicians and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the Quadruple Aim: better more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately a lower total cost to treat. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams their needs and their environment. At Intuitive we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey. We look forward to talking with you again in three months. This concludes the call.,0.003343791,0.003800809,0.000456255
59,59,GE,Dybeck,Happe: And maybe to sort of -- specific on the second half there. So basically if you think about it the beginning of the year we talked about the orders and as Larry mentioned sort of what Healthcare would have been so we are expecting that growth to come in the second half where we see the orders now. And we also have a seasonality before the first half and the second half of the year as you know. So there's a big growth of volume and profit and cash just the seasonality through the second half. And I don't talk to that sort of the strengthening of the organic growth that we're seeing through Healthcare. But actually also within Renewables we have a second half where we know that the orders in the second half on onshore wind U.S. and a couple of customers are also better so that will also improve the second half numbers.Happe: Yes. And if you just compare sort of the EPS range and the cash flow range what we're commenting on is we're saying that our guide is at the low end. And that goes for sort of both KPIs. I would say from a risk opportunity perspective there's less risk on the cash flow side than on the EPS side.Happe: Yes. Sure. So what we are seeing -- well we've talked about the Q1 and the pressure that we see there. So what we are seeing and what we're expecting is that it continues through the second quarter. But then that it starts to ease. And you sort of see the impact of that I would say through the businesses with Aviation being able to sort of ship all the engines that they want towards the second half. We also see I would say especially on Healthcare I mean 9% organic growth if we've gotten everything out that our customers wanted. So we are expecting that to come towards the second half as well. And that will then obviously impact both profit and cash. If you look at the Renewables side it's probably more of a sort of slower trend there highly impacted by the inflation. We do have as I mentioned earlier sort of good orders with reasonable margins in the second half. So we have a positive mix also first half to second half which isn't necessarily inflation. But sort of as we continue to work through that would also improve. I would say Power probably least impacted there. We do have a dynamic that we know of that with our backlog we have more deliveries in the second half. And that's also why we expect to have the I'm going to call it typical seasonality as we saw it last year as well as Power with lower first half volumes versus second half volumes. What I would say we expect to go through all the businesses through the year and get sort of stronger momentum it will be price. So the pricing actions that we're working through especially in the longer cycle businesses you sort of start to see improved pricing in the order side. And Larry mentioned that earlier today that even if you take Onshore Wind International which is an important area for us to increase prices we actually had high single-digit pricing for instance in the first quarter in orders. So as the orders translate into sales and revenue we'll start to more impact from pricing as we go through the year. I would say pricing cost as a balance for the year we expect it to be negative. But we do expect it to be offset by the other actions that we're doing in productivity and restructuring.Happe: Steve thanks for asking 2 questions there. If I start with the working capital we expect even at the low end of the guide to be -- to have a positive impact from working capital. As you know in 2021 we had a good $2 billion of positive flow of working capital and we expect that to be an even higher positive flow in 2022. I would say if you look at it part by part we still expect high single-digit growth. We expect receivables to be under pressure where we would expect inventory to improve and basically the other places of working capital also to be a positive flow for the year. So we would expect that to continue to improve in 2022 as well. And thank you for coming back on the 2Q question. I think I missed that one from you Andy. Sorry about that. So if we talk about the second quarter where we are Larry spoke about what's pressuring the first quarter. So clearly we continued to see that into the second quarter as well. We have the inflation. We have Russia-Ukraine. And we have the renewable situation. And we have the back-end loaded second half as we usually would have. I would say though that there's a lot of good things going on as well especially the aviation return to flight as we expect that to continue to ramp through the year as well as I talked about the power part as well. If we look for the second quarter specifically working capital will have the typical seasonality and that means that 2Q is pressured by working capital. So overall for the second quarter we are expecting low single-digit growth some OMX expansion sequentially and a free cash flow that's better sequentially but still negative.Happe: Yes. And when we talked about 6% so that's the impact on the top line. And 5% of that is from supply chain and we said 1% we attribute to sort of the China and the Russia situation.Happe: So Josh maybe I'll -- sorry Joe I'll start with the first part. So if we look at the Healthcare and the guide that we have we said 25 to 75 bps. I would say that it will depend on how much the supply chain eases in the second half because of the pent-up demand that we have. There's great orders in there. And getting those out at a good pace in the second half then we would be able to get to the part of that range. I would say though that on top of that it's what Larry talked about before we also have the work done on pricing. We have the work done on productivity and as well as sort of pushing the right mix even in Healthcare. So it's still a possibility but it's of course tougher now with lower part of the range. And for '22 to '23 Larry?Happe: And actually Julian I vividly remember that slide so I didn't even have to look it out because it's really about how we get from our profit from sort of 4.6 to where we go in 2022. But just start with the first quarter because you asked about that as well. So in the first quarter we did see positive price but it did not offset the cost on inflation even net of the cost actions. But we do expect that to improve through the year as the pricing impact continues to get larger but also as our work. And we talked about it in 3 different categories. We talked about sourcing actions we talked about productivity and we talked about restructuring. So if you take for the full year I would say what we say now price cost we thought would be basically flat. But what we're seeing now inflation is strengthening and therefore we expect that to be a negative net. But we do expect to be able to offset that with the productivity plans that we have as well as the current restructuring that we've talked about. Another big important part to grow the profit is going to be on the volume side which we also talked about then. And we are saying high single-digit but the low part of that that still means reasonable growth. So that's going to be a good important part of how to get to the profit number for the full year. You asked if we're not doing anything more or what are we doing on productivity and restructuring? What we tried to talk to earlier today was that each of the businesses are going through their plans both on productivity and how to sort of right-size their organization. So I would say as we're speaking all teams are working to increase those numbers and increase the actions since they're also seeing the effect of inflation.,0.00249432,0.002602935,0.000119568
60,60,DE,Jepsen:,Now we are ready to get into the Q&A portion of todayâ€™s call. The operator will provide instructions.Thatâ€™s the industry â€“ sorry if you couldnâ€™t hear me Jerry. The industry â€“ the value that we can create $150 billion is at the highest level. If you think about how does that work its way down to Deere I think there is a couple of steps. Itâ€™s â€“ what is our market share and then what is the share of value between customer and the company. So those would be the components to work that down from $150 billion to what would impact our top line. And as John and Ryan mentioned as we execute and work to unlock the value through the goals that we have laid out today we think there is a significant amount of opportunity not just between here and 2030 but 2030 and beyond.Thanks Jerry. We will go ahead and go to our next question.Thanks Courtney. The â€“ you are right. Today the recurring revenue that we have is relatively small primarily focused around guidance subscriptions in terms of correction signals. So it is a small portion today. And we will begin building that with â€“ as we get out this year with See & Spray Ultimate and the autonomous solution that John mentioned. So that will start the foundation. We would not expect that itâ€™s linear. It will take time to build that base and to see that grow. So thatâ€™s the way that we would frame that up the way we are thinking about that today. As it relates to trade-offs the question there is really as you make some shift to moving from monetizing at point of sale to on a more recurring basis we do expect to see some of that revenue really then move out of the upfront sale of the equipment and then incurred or received as we deliver that value on a more regular basis whether thatâ€™s per year or by usage et cetera.Thanks. We will go to our next question.Yes I will start and this is Josh Steve. The full year definitely if you look at the rest of the year we raised guidance. What we see there is I think two things. One continued unpredictability and challenges in the supply chain that was evident in the first quarter. We think that continues throughout the year. The hard part about that is itâ€™s unpredictable and difficult to forecast which also is driving higher freight cost premium freight in particular as we need to accelerate things to get them into the factories to keep production moving. So those I would say are impacts that are weighing on the business as we go forward. I think importantly as we look at the rest of the year forecast our incrementals are strong. I think from an equipment operations perspective in total incrementals are in the 25% to 30% range specifically on Production and Precision Ag around 35% incremental rest of year. So although we do expect some disruption and choppiness that we discussed through the supply chain we feel good about the ability to execute as we manage through the year.Yes. Just to clarify did you say R&D? Was that your first question?This year we have seen a step-up in R&D and thatâ€™s intentional and focused on the themes that Ryan and John had mentioned today. I think that focus will continue. As we discussed we will be making investments to unlock this value as well as thinking about the journey on our emissions. So I think those things I would expect to continue. We will be making those investments around the themes and around the value that we can create for our customers. On the 20% thatâ€™s equipment operations in total so we havenâ€™t broken out the moving pieces there in terms of the different business segments. Wouldnâ€™t expect they are all the same. And as we go forward and execute I think that will be â€“ we will see where each business lies as we are continuing to unlock value.Thank you. We will go to our next question.Yes. Good morning David this is Josh. I will start there. I would say first and foremost we are looking at what is the value that we can create? And the great thing about this is this is value that is meaningful and impactful for our customers regardless of where we are in the cycle. And when you talk about either reducing their inputs improving their profitability and improving yield. So I think I would say the value creation here is somewhat agnostic of where are we in the cycle. And I think thatâ€™s the beauty of what we can do in addition to the sustainable outcomes that will be beneficial and Jill referred to this. But we believe will create additional revenue opportunity for the customers as it comes to the potential for carbon or other markets as well as commodity differentiation. Thanks David. We will go ahead and go to our next question.Sure. I think the point being that we are making there is today we monetize very heavy at point of sale and the opportunity to make that more accessible and see that technology is carrying that type of model to be more heavily adopted more quickly adopted across more jobs more acres at that different price point and really tied closer to the value thatâ€™s created through the technology is a significant opportunity for our customers and for us to be able to move forward. Thanks Kristen. We will go ahead and take one more question.Thanks Ross. Maybe one thing to clarify. When we think about new value of features or tools solutions thatâ€™s not embedded in that price realization that is really intended to be more from an inflationary perspective. So separate we will see the value and the benefit of the solutions and tools that we are delivering from a technology point of view. Looking at the inflationary environment we are monitoring this and trying to understand what is happening both from an input perspective for our products and solutions and being cognizant of how do we price. And we have priced more dynamically in the last couple of years as a result of that. So I would say we will continue to monitor and adjust our pricing accordingly with inflationary pressure staying high. Will we be above our historical averages in that 2 to 3 points potentially I think thatâ€™s fair but we will continue to be thoughtful there. I think one important thing to remember or consider as it relates to price is increases we are seeing in used prices of equipment. So where we have seen strong increases on new in many cases we have seen more than double that increase on the used side. So trade differentials have actually been pretty attractive from a customer perspective so low levels of inventory have driven used prices to be strong.With that we will wrap up the call. We thank everyone for their time and we will talk soon. Take care.,0.00329711,0.004245996,0.000678138
61,61,T,Stankey:,Thanks very much Brett. Operator can you shift to next question?Phil the short answer is no on the first one. As you know we don't â€“ when we count net adds a migration of the 3G customer to another service plan isn't a net add that's just the migration. And so there wouldn't be any impact to that. And as we've shared with you we restated our base numbers. Those are out there for you to see. And so I think everything you can look at including looking at ARPU characteristics after the restatement you should look at it. And I would actually say this is probably one of the best air interface transitions I've ever seen. When I think about the shutdown of the 2G network and now the shutdown of the 3G network on a proportional basis and the number of subscribers and what we're able to do here I think the team executed incredibly well. Relative to the flow share in the market today I think we have seen over the last several quarters Sprint is -- had an issue for T-Mobile to migrate and manage. And I know they're having to touch that base as they're shutting down the CDMA network and moving things through. And any time you do that that can be disruptive to a customer base. And I think we've benefited in some flow share from Sprint customers who have been evaluating what they want to do and see AT&T as a good choice and a good value as they make that decision to whether or not they want to get a new handset and who they want to get it with. And there has been an element of that in the flow share in the market over not just this last quarter but several quarters as this has been going on. And there was an element of it in this quarter but I don't think it was anything that was out of pattern from what we saw in previous quarters.Hi Simon. So the scaling on C-band is happening now and it will continue. We're not -- as we told you we're deploying mid-year. That's when we have the right kind of equipment for our OneTouch work between the two different spectrum bands that we can touch the tower once and move through. We have capabilities to do pre-work on that. Obviously there are things that we can deploy today to get ourselves ready make sure that we're in the right position. And we can start spending on and be in a position to scale that turn up pretty rapidly as we hit midyear. So I'd say as we told you you're already seeing it move into some of the capital numbers in this quarter and it will continue to ramp as we move through the middle of the year. And then that positions us to do the rapid turnup in the second half of the year and hit the POP targets that we've communicated to you through the Analyst Day. On supply chain I'm conservative on this. I don't ever want to say we're in good hands but here's the dynamic that I think is occurring. I actually think for the industry in aggregate globally there are going to be some supply chain pressures at least from what I know where chip manufacturing is it's going back into some of the key OEMs. However I think what you should keep in mind is that the North American market is an incredibly profitable market for providers of equipment on a global basis. If you were to start ranking it relative to other continents it is the most profitable market of any continent out there. And so as a result of that if you're into a situation where there's some degree of constraint I think if you're an equipment manufacturer you have the motivation to make sure that you supply your most profitable market first. And as a result of that I don't want to say that we're out of the woods but I think that we're likely to see a prioritization given the dynamics of this market that may put other parts of the globe a little bit lower down the list in terms of availability of equipment and services moving forward. So right now I think we have a good handle on things. Our vendors are telling us they can meet our build expectations. We've done a lot of second order diligence on our equipment. We're not just taking their word for it. We look at sourcing on key components within if we can't do every element. And sometimes it's the smallest and silliest things that end up causing a problem. We've looked at the harder things like at chip levels and feel that there's confidence in those estimates right now that they can bring them through. And so I'm not expecting that to be a problem. But as you know the global supply chains are fragile right now and crazy things happen whether it's neon gas coming out of the Ukraine or whatever and we'll continue to work through that. On the fixed wireless side I think you hit the nail on the head. Look we have hundreds of thousands of fixed wireless subscribers already. We've used it pretty aggressively in parts of the business segment where a particular business customer that we support finds it to be the right and best solution for how their particular business is set up. We continue to believe that there are going to be applications for fixed wireless deployment moving forward and we think our network will be well suited to do that after we get through the mid-band deployment. But to your point it's going to be what I would call use specific. I don't intend to go into dense urban and metropolitan areas where I can build fiber infrastructure and offer broadband and try to use fixed wireless as the solution to serve broadband customers where we see estimates traffic growing 5x over the next five years and performance requirements needing to get significantly better. And we watch our Fiber base we watch our customers and we don't believe -- we watch our copper base of customers and we don't believe a product that's doing sub 100 megabits is going to be a viable product in the market over the next couple of years based on how we're seeing consumers use the service and what they expect to do in some of these urban areas where there's broader and more dense environments with more people in a living unit. But there are clearly places in more rural areas where fixed wireless will be the best way to get the most amount of bandwidth out to a customer. And we believe we can play in those spaces and there'll be some former ADSL locations where fixed wireless will be a substantial step-up in opportunity. And there's going to be places where the government comes in with subsidy in very less densely populated areas that fixed wireless is going to be the solution. And sure there may be some niche customers who can live on a very niche oriented product for their particular use characteristic and find it interesting but I don't believe that's the main part of the market. And I think it's really hard to market niche broadband products frankly over time. And I think market performance of what we're able to do is we blanket an area with a robust fixed fiber broadband service are showing in the numbers that we're putting up in our performance in the market right now.Hi Dave. Let me give the front end. I'll try to do all three of them and Pascal can jump in and offer anything he wants. I think we're a dividend competitor moving forward meaning I want the dividend to remain at a competitive level relative to others out in the market which means I'll pay attention to the yield of the dividend. As we've told you as we move past 2023 and we start to think about what we do with discretionary capital as we have the balance sheet where we want it to be the Board is going to evaluate where the best returns come back into the business. And there's a lot of choices at that point. That could be what we choose to do on equity could be choose on what we choose to do with dividend it could be choose -- could be choices on we make -- what we make within the deployment on new business opportunities within the business for organic growth. We'll evaluate those in the complete portfolio where we stand and the relative competitiveness of the value proposition of the AT&T equity with others in the market and adjust accordingly. And so to answer your question we'll pay attention to the yield but I don't necessarily intend to every quarter look at it and say my expectation is that I have to grow the dividend in any given quarter relative to not answering the question of how do we stand competitively in the market and whether or not we think we've got the right kind of mix of how we're investing our capital and deploying it within the business. When you ask about refreshing the go-to-market plan it could possibly be two things you're driving that. One could be comments I've made about what we're doing to refine the brand. If that's kind of the angle that you're going after is that where your question is?Well there'll be a change when it doesn't work and it's working just fine. And I'm probably not going to tell you what the change is going to be when it doesn't work anymore because that would kind of be self-defeating. But it's working just fine. And I would have guessed maybe last year that we might be hitting a point where we had to think about it differently we're not. And I think that's great. We have thoughts on where our next path will go if we need to go down that path. But we're not at that point at this juncture. I love the momentum we're seeing. I think it was a great quarter. I like what we're seeing right now. And I like that we're watching others having to in any given week or month adjust their approach in the market while we continue to do exactly what we're doing. And as we continue to have the opportunity to grow our footprint between the two services it opens up even more opportunity for us to do things on a combined basis that we're seeing really good progress on. Admittedly our new footprint is still relatively small. It will grow over time. But I'm really excited about what that means for us moving forward in the future. And I think as I would stress one of the things that's really important to understand is we're not getting our growth just through one set of go-to-market actions here. I know you're focused and you're thinking about what we're doing in the consumer space right now. But I want to stress FirstNet has been really strong for us. What we're doing in the business customers that we have close relationships have been really strong for us. We're going to see us start to grow in some wholesale revenues later this year that we have not had in our mix up to this point in time. So our growth portfolio is a balanced portfolio and it's not hinging on any one strategy. And I've been saying this all along you need to understand that there's not any one thing we're doing it's a variety of things that we're doing on distribution that are adding up to the sum total of this and feel good about that. Your last question on financial relationship with Warner Bros. Discovery we expect there's going to continue to be a relationship with Warner Bros. Discovery going forward. I expect that that relationship will still be important to both companies. But I don't expect over time that it's going to be ultimately exclusive. I think Warner Bros. Discovery will want flexibility to be able to do things with a variety of players in the market. I think I understand why they'd want to do that. I think there are things that AT&T can do to accommodate that and still have the right value proposition for our customers moving forward. But I still expect there'll be a strong trading relationship given what we've had in the market is a portion of the success that we've had in being able to keep and retain customers moving forward. And we'll fine-tune that a bit as we move forward and make sure it's right for both companies. But I don't expect that it will continue to be what I call a captive or exclusive arrangement. Pascal do you want to add anything?Thanks very much operator we can shift to the next question.Doug so if I go back -- I don't know I don't play a story in here but if I go back probably three years ago there were several comments I made or observations I made about the SVOD business one of which was that managing customer subscriptions was going to be an important element of the long-term sustainability of the business. And that was at a time when I think somewhere in the industry may be advocating that rampant password sharing was somehow a good thing for these products. And I had a little bit more jaded view of that. I think there were probably some articles that were written to criticize me for having a little bit more jaded view of that. But it drove a lot of the thought process at the front end of the HBO Max product where we were thoughtful about how we built the product. We were thoughtful about making sure that we give customers enough flexibility but we don't want to see rampant abuse. And so I'm not going to go into all the details but there were a lot of things and features built in to the product that are consistent with the user agreement that has terms and conditions of how they can and can't use it. And we've enforced and we've enforced them obviously in a way that I think has been customer-sensitive. You don't see anybody complaining massively about it. But I can tell you that we actively in any given month are looking at how particular users are using the product and have features and capabilities technically to limit what I would call rampant abuse. And so I would tell you that I think that's the right way for the industry to be managed. And I think maybe some are going to adjust practices and approaches overtime to try to get their arms around that but I don't think it's the broadband providers' role in making that happen. I think it's the owner of the applications role in making that happen. And I don't necessarily expect that we'd be trying to work on a product or service to market back to other providers to say we can help you manage that. I think there are adequate tools available in software and then how you manage your application to be able to do that. And I can tell you from our own experience we feel like we've done that reasonably effectively in the interest of the product. I'll let Pascal go ahead and maybe pick up the second part of the question.Thank you very much Doug. And time for one last question operator.Yes. Well let me see if I can answer your question and Pascal can jump in if he wants to. First of all we don't disclose the mix. But what I would say to you is what you should understand is we do give you some information that you should be able to understand that we're getting a healthy growth of new subscribers to AT&T. You know I think our aggregate share numbers in broadband in the market today and you know where those stand. We shared with you that our plan rates after we're in the market about three years has roughly an equal split of market share which is a substantial increase to where our aggregate market share in our broadband business previously stood. You can't -- three-year period of time of fiber growth to get to equivalent market share in an area do that without taking customers from the other side of the house. It's mathematically impossible to do that. And so I think the way you think about it if I were in your shoes an analyst and you look at cash flows over a three-year period and you look at footprint expansion and you see that market shift you should conclude over time that we're actually picking up as I've described it share points in a way that I've never seen a product move in my career. Now admittedly we put a lot of money into this infrastructure. And we should expect to see that kind of share point move and we're getting it. So we are winning our share of new customers as a result of this. And we report to you as well our aggregate revenues and we report to you our growth and decline in our fiber and our copper base. And I think it's pretty easy for you to see the motion of what's happening in the copper base as to how much of it is likely moving to fiber and how much of it isn't. And I feel really good about how we're competitively performing. I see nothing in our performance that suggests we should be tamping down ultimate pen rates because of our approach. Quite the opposite as we shared with you our pen rates are accelerating they're not declining. If you look at where we were several years ago and a lot of our new builds right now we're achieving year two pen rates in year one. And there's a lot of reasons behind that not just one. The great product is the foundation of it. The part of it is how we're building right now we're much less Swiss cheese which allows us to be a lot more effective in our marketing. And we've developed much better tactics as we move into a neighborhood to be able to get early adopters to move in at a much higher rate and pace. And that has a huge impact on the economics of the business case. If we sustain that moving forward I'm going to frankly be relooking the overall economics of the fiber business case because one of the big variables on leverage in the business case is if you can accelerate your penetration by a year it dramatically improves the return characteristics. So I'm really proud of what the team has done in that regard. And we have no expectation by the time we get to year three that that's going to suggest that we shouldn't expect our split of the market as a result of that. Remember we're not charging more to the customer. We're giving the customer a better experience. We're getting rid of promotional pricing; it is a pain point for customers. They hate it. They hate the 12-month mark. And when they're using another service that 12-month mark means their price is going up $15 or $20 and that's just a really bad thing for a customer. And so now we put out a very simple straightforward constant price where the customer isn't going to see that step up in 12 months. They know what the equipment pricing is on the front end. They're getting the square deal. They're getting a great product. And they're clams and it shows in the data.That's an accurate assumption Walt. It has to do with the ramp directly from DISH. And I think the way you should think about this it's public information that I think DISH got a little bit of a reprieve from T-Mobile on some of the legacy network availability and some help on that slowed down the front end a little bit. And I think you're aware of where DISH is in their deployment and debugging their network so that it actually can function and work properly. I think they recently announced a milestone as to what they're doing around that. Those two things are the drivers of when that transition occurs a combination of when those customers need to move off of another network as well as as DISH starts to move people onto their network new customers coming in those all play in the wholesale arrangement as that volume starts to ramp. So I think a surrogate for understanding that trend line we'll be watching the loading of new customers on to DISH's new network capabilities.Just really briefly to all of you. First of all thanks for joining us today. And I really want to extend my thanks and appreciation to all of you on the call. I know it's been going on internally at AT&T in terms of the number of filings schedules we've had to develop the information we've had to put out over the course of the last month or so. And I know that that puts a lot of work on all of you to kind of parse through that get through this transition that we've been working through as a business. I want to extend my appreciation for your patience in that regard. And what I can promise is it should settle down here a little bit going forward. And I'm as excited about that as I'm sure you are. So thanks very much for being with us today and we'll talk to you again in 90 days.,0.002899218,0.003433108,0.000275967
62,62,PLD,Schnur,: Yes Ki Bin I would just add for us 3PLs continue to be the most active user in the market. We saw that in the first quarter. We saw that last year. Retail e-commerce for us has probably fallen to about the third category in terms of overall demand. So as Jim said it's -- I think most of our customers are early on in their venture towards building out their own e-commerce platforms.: Yes. Look it's hard to find a soft spot in today's world right? I would tell you for us Houston as â€“ weâ€™ve talked about it before Houston is probably in the one market that's been a little soft for us. But markets this past quarter markets like Minneapolis Raleigh Chicago Dallas Atlanta were all great markets for us in terms of rent growth and overall activity. Nashville has been a good market for us as of late. So it's -- again it's hard to pick a market that's not doing well right now.: Yes. Our top 1 was 3PLs. That made up -- for us that made up a little under half of our overall activity. Consumer product goods would be I guess the next category I would throw out there in terms of activity. Retail e-commerce would be the third. And then sort of what we call manufacturers assembled goods would be the fourth category.: I would say with e-commerce and 3PLs have probably shifted. Consumer products goods have always been in that -- usually in the top 4 for our portfolio. Amazon's activity the past 3 4 5 years has always put e-commerce up near the top.: We typically buy I would say 2 different -- today there's either private sellers people who have owned land for a long time whether that was a business or owned by a family or a private company. Two is I would say companies that are -- that we're redeveloping a site something they've owned for a long time. And in terms of -- your other question was our development in the existing business parks that might be --: One of our projects looking at the list here I think one of our projects is in an existing business park. Everything else was a site that we've been working on and had it in some version of our land bank that was asked on this call a number of times over the past year.: Sure. I wouldn't read a lot into the fact that we started 3 buildings this quarter. It's just a timing thing with lots of land we had. We like the markets we're in. Obviously we've got a long history in this market. We've got a very deep customer base. And we're in the right submarket. Indi's probably got some headlines recently about some overbuilding. I would tell you that's occurring on -- for those of you unfamiliar with Indianapolis on the East side or the far South side it's not where these buildings are located. Again we've got great history here. I think we know this market better than anyone. And I expect those projects to be successful. Longer term we haven't been super active on the development front in Indi. It's a good market for us. And when we see opportunities we'll take advantage of them.,0.002768755,0.003177524,0.000408769
63,63,NOW,McDermott:,"Thank you very much Kash for the question. So the distribution I again reiterate our focus right now is on the enterprise. We're an enterprise software market leader. We have lots of work still left to do in geographic expansion for the company. There's a huge opportunity in markets like Japan obviously all across Europe LatAm. I really like to focus on markets like Canada of course trade markets the way they want to be treated in that localized style. We obviously have lots of expansion rights in the Middle East and other places. And I'm looking at bellwether markets like Germany France and the U.K. which are already now starting to take off beautiful. So there's a geographic component. We also have segmented the way we develop software and take that software to market by industry. And as you know we're very focused on your industry of course financial services one but there's telecom there's manufacturing there's every industry under the sun in motion but we've gone strong with 6 including life sciences and so forth. And then persona-based. If you think about taking this platform across the enterprise you have to speak intelligently to all the C-level executives that run the enterprise. And we have a Rubik's Cube formula around the geography the industry and the persona that's now being executed at an art form level by our great marketing communications leader and his team. So I'm super impressed with that. We also did something I think very interesting with life step that a lot of people haven't picked up on but life step is a next-generation customer platform. And when you think about having one user experience across the whole enterprise where people are in and out different screen styles to figure out what they're observing you also have an observability platform that is a direct-to-consumer platform by design that I think is a precursor to many of the things we can do with the core. And also we could take the core and put it in prepackaged ready-to-run solutions and build an ecosystem around that and turn on a whole new channel of small and mid-market channel partners as we take the company everywhere. And so now on the big partner channel there isn't a single one out there in the top 10 that doesn't at least start with a B meaning we don't have million-dollar conversations we have billion-dollar conversations and we even have the top one now chasing $10 billion. So I mean Kash in short we're going to chase every market opportunity all over the world and we're going to win. And we have a team that's ready to conquer this market like never before. It's so exciting here right now Kash. I just wish you could be in the building to see it.That's great. But can you feel it Kash? Can you feel the building?Thank you Kash.Well the first thing to recognize here Matt is huge market opportunities don't require anyone for -- to lose for us to win. They're huge market opportunities. So we'll still integrate as we already do with the largest participants in that market. And we want them to be successful because customers have invested in them and our way of going about things is that's great let's make that customer successful together. That's why they integrate seamlessly into the NOW platform. At the same time we have many customers that realize that ServiceNow can out-innovate just about anybody in the marketplace so they want us to do more for them. And clearly observability was one of those categories. And we just got there a lot faster with light step because we believe Ben and his team are the most innovative in the industry. And we're just so proud to have such trust and partnership with them and such big dreams together. So Lightstep launched incident response as you said. It's the first new product since joining ServiceNow and it's big. So incident response will add a lot of context and automation to the incident response process and customers are looking for that. And by the way they may even have more than one incident response vendor in there. So we don't rail against others. What we try to do is work for the customer. We've put our part hard hat on roll up our sleeves and we go to work. Lightstep also launched an industry-first unification of observed billing analytics and they also get collaborative notebooks. So these innovations are breaking down those silos I referenced between metrics and tracing and streamlining its critical SRE workflow space. So in Q1 for example we signed some cool deals along with Plaid which we're very proud of. And that's a data networking company as you know and they're powering the Fintech and digital finance product space and they're using Lightstep for complete visibility into distributed architectures and they're allowing Plaid to investigate CI and CV issues and they're doing it 20 times faster than they used to. And we also got Airtable again cool brand next-generation brand and they're building collaborative applications and they're driving the reliability of complex distributed systems and proactively improving performance for users and again more effectively monitoring and resolving both system-wide and specific customer issues but they're doing it with one UI and they're not balancing people in and out of different experiences. And this is what I keep going back to when you talk about real platform innovation and the integrity of a consumer-grade experience and you can do that across an entire enterprise. That's why I believe our Board of Directors did a great job of defining enterprise software company in the 21st century is doing it with a DESCO 21C logo. So now we have 18 000 people that all they think about is DESCO 21C whether you're innovating covering a customer or just driving the conversation. We know where we're going.Thank you very much.Sure. Sure. Well thank you very much Alex for your very kind remarks. It means a lot to us. Our team is doing a really great job. And when they hear that you just inspire us to go higher and we appreciate it. So thank you. We've done a lot in terms of the vertical coverage. We have our great Chief Operating Officer CJ Desai now not only running all of engineering with what we believe to be the best engineering team in the business but also he's overseeing our industry orientation and the whole go-to-market around that. And he teams up in a beautiful way with the go-to-market team our leader Paul Smith and great regional presence. We have just super proud of our team. But banking is really simplifying the whole middle to back-office operation context and financial services is going really well. I referenced Barclays but there's just so many that are all-in on ServiceNow. Our telecommunication solution is really aligning customer care and service assurance transforming -- just think about how communication service providers deliver great customer experiences. And you can't get away with fixing problems anymore. You've got to proactively anticipate these issues before they even come up. And if they do come up you've got to address them quickly to maximize availability and quality of service. So we're seeing a lot of traction in telecommunications and we're really becoming the standard across the board. We're super happy with manufacturing and what we're doing there operations technology management driving the whole notion of what these manufacturers are trying to do to have their critical technology available and provide visibility and security of all of their assets. Another one I would underscore is health care and life sciences service management. How do you connect cross functional health systems and teams and simplify how people engage with the health care providers payers pharma companies and medical device organizations? It's all about the patient experience. And high-tech manufacturing another one that's really come on strong for us. I mean I could give you more but those are the ones that are just rocking right now. And one theme I will give you is you can't give a customer a 3-star Michelin experience unless you first give it to your employees. And the NOW platform is really controlling the conversation now for enlightened decision-makers because they're like I've got to tether my IT excellence to the employee experience and I've got to take care of my customers in new and highly innovative ways. And this platform does the magic they need done but it does it in days or weeks not months and months and months and years. And finally in all these solutions we're cooperating with those systems of record. The customer knows that they're there and they've got them and they're very important to their business. So we just come in quickly and make everything better for everyone.Thank you very much Alex.Gregg it's a great question. Actually we're so encouraged with our core. Our core is growing beautifully. And if you look at the revenue outcome from our core it's right there at the corporate rate. So what you're seeing has nothing to do with any dilution in that core business. On the contrary we've got enormous uplift with our Pro SKU as you know. That's a 25% uplift. So it's 30% penetrated now. So there's lots of people that like it and there's many more to go. So we have lots of room left on the Pro SKU. If you think about the kind of customers where we're winning I mean the great brands Amerisource Bergen Baptist Health Regeneron DIC pharma -- I mean it goes on and on. Royal Bank of Canada Telefonica. Every -- Wipro for example just like sort of complete generational change with it. So let me make sure I make it clear. The core business has never been stronger. There's no revenue dilution whatsoever. What is happening we are landing and expanding. And you're right the IT concept really did form the basis for us to move into the employee experience the customer experience the whole creative workflow where citizen developers are now really creating the future they want to see. And without that ever solid magnificent core none of that would have been possible. So I want to really set the record straight. Our team is doing great across all these segments. The newer or the younger ones are obviously going to get some more land and expand opportunities. But we love on our core and we love our leaders.Thank you very much Kirk. I have to tell you one thing that did surprise me a little bit during the whole virtual environment is CEOs were looking for a good conversation. So we were able to participate in those conversations then which is obviously helping us now. And we were also able to bring large-scale management team gatherings with our team and their team so we did good. But now that we're opening up we should do even better. So I looked at my calendar for the year I'll catch my family here and there on a weekend because I'm leaving Sunday for Europe and after that tour of Europe we'll hitting Asia very very soon after that. So we're going full speed open up the company. We're doing these knowledge events in four distinct locations as I mentioned. Our sellers are going out on the street and our management and going out on the street because that's where the customers are. And never forget that United Airlines commercial when a guy walks in he's got a bunch of envelopes and looks at his management team. We were sitting around the table gauging it themselves and it goes let's go visit some customers. So I expect we're going to get a lot of tailwinds out of that because you're right to build trust with net new logos it happens in person. It's hard to do that in a digital format. To really expand the relationship to an enterprise scale it really does require a good meeting of the minds and emotional trust and we'll do that. So I really think this is going to be another step function improvement in ServiceNow's future because as a platform provider getting our customers healthy through some of the challenges that they're fighting through is a seminal moment in our history and I'm excited.Thank you very much. Appreciate.Absolutely. I really appreciate the question. So here's the situation. Our customers need help. The impact part of this equation think of it much more in the value delivery context than any kind of price increase. It's really accelerating the value realization for the customer against the software that they've already invested in and they want to extract as much business impact as they possibly can. And for too long these customer relationships across every company you can think of is managed by a deck at a point of sale and then ultimately the sale is made and then the consultants come in. But it's kind of like job changes people do different things and a year later someone's saying """"Hey how did we do with that implementation again? Did we get what we bargained for?"""" And what we're basically doing is making sure that they do and that there's a professional format in doing that. And not just with ServiceNow but also for our great partners. So just think of this concept as the NOW platform in ServiceNow is the place where every conversation takes place between the partner the customer and ServiceNow. There's no e-mails there's no texts there's no chat on the side. It's all on one platform with everything detailed and spelled out and we measure everything in real time with all the analytics and all the business outcomes spilled out in a way that could be presented to any Board of Directors. So also on the pricing again I want to be clear like we're not looking to make up for inflationary pressures by putting it on the customer. There are many new customers. There are many more logos. There are many more expansions to our platform. All we want to make sure of is that we do things highly professional and we know the ranges where our professional expertise should be valued at. And in that valuing and in that business impact to the customer a fair agreement is reached. We even developed a pricing structure that enables customers to partner with us and look at the enterprise value of doing things with ServiceNow not just 1 departmental value. And I think that whole idea of being a solutions and business impact platform company is resonating big time internally and externally. And incidentally if you're interested we've done more than 100 deals right now on ServiceNow Impact. And what we're seeing is user adoption is speeding up values being accelerated and customer Net Promoter and satisfaction is going through the moon. And as Gina said the retention rates prove it that it's best in the business.No it's a really great question Brad. Thank you very much. As you know this idea of hyper automation workflows on the NOW platform means a lot to our existing customers. So what they expect from ServiceNow is to remain that highly innovative unicorn that we have been one that organically builds better more substantial product experiences with every passing day. And in some cases they want us to integrate with other tools in the marketplace. But in other cases if we can build it and it's all integrated into the NOW platform they would like ServiceNow to own all of that and we give them choice. And what you see here in this latest release we brought together process mining automation machine learning RPA and low-code app development into a seamless combined product experience. And now customers are going to be quickly innovating and improving the way work flows across the enterprise. So our job is to be helpful and integrate with all the market participants especially when customers find that pleasing but we also need to innovate ourselves and continue to build out this platform story in a way that's super compelling and it's generational. And that's why I said when I first came to ServiceNow organic is delicious.Thank you. Thank you very much. I look forward to spend some time together Brad.",0.256131794,0.982603967,0.401502917
64,64,ELV,Boudreaux:,Great. Well thanks very much for the question. And I think myNEXUS is a great example as our AM and Beacon and some of the other assets that we have inside of the Diversified Business Group. When we brought myNEXUS into the family the opportunity obviously to transition patients from the hospital to the home we had strong expertise with them already in our Medicare Advantage business. But part of our goal is to do two things: one to take our assets and embed them in our value-based payment arrangements. So as I mentioned we have a number of those arrangements already that we're working on both with primary care assets that we've invested in plus also those that we're moving to value-based care. We see that as a downstream opportunity but we also have an opportunity to capitate that business inside of Anthem's health plan and there's a huge runway for us there. And so generally we've started in our diversified business group first with a fee-for-service arrangement. And then as we get confidence in our ability to execute and do well with that we're moving that along the risk continuum to cap and that's a good example of that. It might be a good opportunity for Pete to share a little bit about how he sees what's happening in our diversified business group and maybe even talk a little bit more about myNEXUS capabilities. Pete?Sure. Morgan why don't you address that?Yes. Thanks Morgan. I think to add to that he mentioned a couple of areas that have been really important for us. One is consumer experience our investment in digital platforms. I mentioned Sydney Preferred has been very popular along with our consumer advocacy model. And then the last area is our high-performance networks. Across all of the Blue system I think we've done really well and that's been a really strong validation of our unique cost of care position for the system. So thanks very much for the question. Again really strong selling season and very encouraged by what we're seeing.Thanks Lisa. I'm going to have Pete address that.Thanks for the question Ricky. First and foremost I want to say that we are looking forward to serving the retirees of the city of New York and extremely -- remain extremely pleased about have been awarded this contract -- have been awarded this contract. We've had a long relationship with the city and we do continue to administer those benefits for the employees and our fee-based business today just as a bit of background. As you mentioned based on the legal challenge the city did not move forward as planned on April 1 and the city has appealed the decision however. At this stage given that process we'll share more definitive information when it becomes available. As you think about how you should think about the financial impact it's not dissimilar from what we said on our last call when we had a three-month delay at hand which was directionally slightly positive as we're still incurring as you know run rate costs from being ready to go on 1/1 and that still remains the case today. So thank you question and we look forward to serving the city.Yes. Thanks very much for the question and thanks for bringing it up. I'll just sort of start really at a broader perspective. Our care provider strategy is really a core component of our enterprise strategy which is the integration of our Whole Health focus. And we've set a couple of key things. One better outcomes we see by capitating and moving to more upside downside risk. Certainly higher satisfaction better and predictable outcomes from our health plans higher star ratings which we think because of the alignment drives and greater stability for our benefits business MA our Medicare Advantage business but also our Commercial and Medicaid businesses are a really important part of the strategy. Over the past year we've made some very significant advancements in that strategy particularly with our investments in risk-bearing primary care providers and aggregators but we've also been advancing those that we haven't invested in around our VBC process. And that ties very much to our high-performing networks and we're seeing growth there as I mentioned a few moments ago. So -- as I think about those and your direct question these are a kind of an early stage. We do see pull-through opportunities. So there's more than just your question about how does it affect MA. We see pull-through opportunities in our diversified business group and they're resonating things like combining Aspire with those groups in their palliative care offering. We just talked about myNEXUS a little bit. And again those are opportunities for us against to advance our overall performance at Anthem generally. As we move we're moving very specifically to your question to move to more capitation risk within the Anthem health plans. This year we started some of the services like AIM. But our strategy again isn't reliant on a single model. So I want to again reiterate that I've shared that in the past. As we see our value-based care mature we think that there's a number of models in that. Specifically about 60% of our consolidated medical expense as I mentioned is paid under VBC. That number is interesting but I don't think it's the most important. The number that we're really targeting is moving upside and downside risk. We have global capitation and as I mentioned Today we're about low double-digit range across our enterprise with about 40% in Medicare in capitated arrangements to put some perspective on that. Our target is that about 1/3 of our overall spend in value-based care by 2025 we'll have downside risk. So again a pretty significant move and again that's across Medicaid Commercial and Medicare do you get a sense of the breadth of the strategy that we're deploying. So overall feel good about the progress we're making. I think there are a number of value drivers across our business beyond just the simple question around Medicare Advantage. But clearly that's an important one both for top line and bottom line in our Medicare as well as our other businesses. So thanks very much for the question. And next question please.And maybe Morgan to comment a little bit about what's happening in employer decision-making?And thanks Morgan John just to put a fine point on it Josh you think the strong growth that we've seen particularly across the commercial business is a really nice runway for us to add additional services. And that's really been the trajectory of our business over the last several years is continuing to consolidate employers and continuing to demonstrate our value first on the medical cost side but also on digital tools and other things that we're bringing to market. So we feel good about the trajectory and the opportunity that we have. And again very strong growth and we're really pleased to see it.I think we have time for one last question.Yes. Thanks for the question George. I think first there's no question that the labor market is tight. So as you think about inflation we hear it certainly from our provider partners and we see it in certain parts of our own business. Now let me start with the biggest bucket which is hospital pricing. As you know the majority of our contracts are three years in duration. So we negotiate roughly 1/3 of those each year. And yes there is more pressure on the system. But at this point we're not seeing incremental rate pressure. And quite frankly we believe our ultimate responsibility is -- that's paramount for our customer is affordability. So we have -- we're keeping costs contained to the lowest possible level and take that responsibility very seriously. It's really the core of kind of frankly what we do. We're also taking the opportunity though to change this conversation and make it less a transactional conversation and move to value-based care which has been the core part of our strategy with all of our providers. So we believe that there is an opportunity to transition from just unit cost negotiation and volume-based discussions to value-based care. And our strategy is key in that context. So we think that that's a core element of this paying for outcomes and paying for value. We've been investing as you heard through the discussion that we've had in tools that help our providers make that transition to value-based care and also help safeguard and mitigate some of the uncertainty that they have. So that's a core part of we think what's important in managing that. We're watching these dynamics closely. And we've been refining our high-performance high value-based care model. So again we think that an acceleration opportunity in our own business. We're strongly committed to digitizing and looking for end-to-end improvements across our business. We've been on a multiyear journey around that. We look at a number of areas around our own -- how do we improve experiences? How do we tie things end to end better? How do we improve our own efficiencies looking at touchless claims as an example simplifying our pre-authorization processes investments in better provider finders? So a number of the things that we're investing in around our digital transformation helps us in terms of our own internal cost structure but also improves the cost structure of our trading partners care providers and our customers. And again affordability we think is critical in this environment in the scenario that we believe is our role and responsibility and are very focused on it. So we have a number of tools or those on the provider side really focused on value-based care and then on our own side around really changing workflows and digitization and moving much more aggressively into that space. So thank you very much for the question. I'd now like to close by saying thank you. We're pleased to have carried forward our momentum into 2022 and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continue to deliver against the financial targets we shared with you at our investor conference last year. Across our organization we're accelerating innovation to advance our digital capability and resources simplifying our processes improving our consumer experience and delivering products and services to champion a Whole Health approach and advanced health beyond health care for consumers at all stages of their lives. We're fueled by a passion for making a positive difference in the world and we're improving health by addressing consumer needs at a personal level removing barriers to care and creating more meaningful connections across the lifetime of milestones and experiences. We'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to bring increasing value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Anthem and have a great rest of the week.,0.199431467,0.982164979,0.391367185
65,65,GS,Solomon:,So in terms of our strategy we would expect over time that as GreenSky continues to originate we would take those loans onto our balance sheet. We certainly would retain the flexibility to securitize some of that risk ourselves as they have previously. But the goal over time is to ramp up those balances onto our balance sheet. I think they had origination volumes of approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter. And so we're stepping into them based on that level of activity and our ambition is to continue to grow the origination with them.The only thing I would add to that Devin is I just highlight back in the February update we put out a $4 billion revenue target. And I just want to tie that target to what Denis said when he said most of the investment was made. Most of the investment to drive that revenue target is in the ground and so that's something I want to amplify. And then just finally because you referenced it our partnership with Apple is very very strong. While there's been a Bloomberg article about what Apple is doing Apple or we have -- have not commented on the direction of that partnership and we spend a lot of time and I would just say we're very comfortable with the opportunity set in front of us with that partnership.Well as we've said always we're a pay-for-performance culture. This is our best estimate is the right comp ratio based on the performance and the mix in the first quarter. We manage this very closely. We're comfortable that we will pay people appropriately and competitively. And we will also obviously pay for performance. So I'm not going to speculate going forward but you have data points from our behavior set on this over a long period of time. And we obviously -- the one thing I'd just highlight is our focus on our efficiency ratio and that's something we want to think more about is comp and noncomp and driving to the efficiency ratio. And so that also affects our decision-making as we move forward.Sure and I appreciate the question Dan. I mean I would say that we were a scale provider before that acquisition but that acquisition certainly strengthens our position in Europe. It opens that some interesting distribution channel and it accelerates some of our capabilities around ESG-oriented products. So it was a good step forward to expand that growth. I believe -- Carey will correct me if I'm wrong it's the fifth largest active asset manager in the world at the moment. We see opportunity based on our footprint our global position our client mix our strong position and alternative to continue to grow that business both organically and potentially inorganically as we did with NN and so we're going to continue to strengthen our position there but we see a lot of upside across the business platform and continue to be excited about our capabilities and alternatives and our ability to expand that opportunity for the firm.Well you can see from our earnings the growth of the wealth business year-over-year. We continue to be focused on that opportunity. And I'd just highlight that that's a process that takes time. You add wealth advisers you add footprint. It's a slower growth -- it's a slower process if you do it organically. But we see it as a very big opportunity. I think we have an aspirational brand in the wealth space. It's only been the last couple of years first with the United Capital acquisition and also to our AECO channel we're meaningfully expanding our distribution of wealth products and corporations that we've been focused on really broadening that footprint. I think we're off to a good start there but I think there's a lot of organic opportunity to still exist I think our Ayco channel Goldman Sachs Ayco is a very very unique platform to work through corporations. And I do see a trend in this competitive environment where corporations are more focused on helping our employees with Wealth Management services.Yes I think Gerard it's a hard question to answer very specifically and some of it depends on what kind of pressure the business that's making those decisions is under. But I think if you want me to make a very generic generalization these are not things it doesn't take a year for people's mindset around the reality of markets to reset. It's more something that happens real time over months or quarters.Well there's no question that -- and I've tried to say it in different ways and there's no science to this. And no one knows obviously where the macro environment goes as we go forward. But when you look at the volumes and the levels of 2020 and 2021 we've said repeatedly that those volumes were at levels that were not sustainable and are a reflection of some of that monetary fiscal policy. That doesn't mean when you contract the monetary and fiscal policy that these businesses go away and contract proportionately. I think these are big businesses. Thereâ€™s a lot of capital raising advisory work and intermediation and financing that will continue to go on. But there's no question it's not going to operate at the levels that we saw in 2021.Sure. Thank you for the question and to help through that. I think there's a couple of thing that we expect over the balance of the year and beyond as we move through this rate cycle. On the one hand we do expect to continue to originate balances and as it relates to our own balance sheet sensitivity that is modestly asset sensitive. So when you take that feature combined with increased quantum of interest-earning assets given the forward curve we think that will be a benefit to the firm. The other thing that I should mention which is separate but probably also important just to be clear on and that is in the past we had made reference to the impact of a rising rate environment on our money markets business and the impact that fee waivers had and the roll-off of fee waivers may have on the forward. I would just point out that in the first quarter we had fee waivers of about $80 million versus in the fourth quarter was about $150 million. And on the forward we expect those to be negligible. So that too obviously only a one-time benefit with the first hike but that should provide some tailwind to our results as well.Yeah. Look I think I would just refocus you on my comments previously. Overall NII sensitivity is modestly asset sensitive I think just given the relative size even though we've grown it substantially given our relative size relative to some of our larger competitors. And I think that proxy that I offer you on behalf of the firm is a good way of thinking about it.Well at a high level Andrew what I'd say is we're certainly engaged with our clients around their interest in the space. But in terms of our product offering and what we can do we're really following a regulatory lead. But at the moment the regulatory lead for big regulated banks is very restrictive and very very small. I don't have great insight into how that will or will not change during the course of 2022 but we're engaged in dialogue with our clients. And certainly when you think about blockchain more broadly in terms of how it supports the infrastructure payment systems and other activities in the financial markets we're extremely engaged and invested in thinking about how Goldman Sachs participates in that and how that will affect different business channels and business opportunities because that's to me a little bit separate from cryptocurrency -- clients' interest in cryptocurrency.,0.003323629,0.004013836,0.000418313
66,66,MS,Yeshaya:,Thanks Gerard for the question. I -- actually I know a lot of the peers have released this morning. So I havenâ€™t looked specifically at this quarterâ€™s number in terms of this -- the public market share. But what I can tell you is that we have seen increased share over time. I think we are really proud of the position that we have made in both of the sales and trading franchises. A lot of that has to do with what James discussed more directly in his script which is building these -- investing our people and talent both geographically and also making sure that we have it across different functions. So all of these things are important I think itâ€™s decades in the making rather than just one quarter and we are really proud of the way that we thought about the continue -- the continuous velocity of all of our resources to make sure that we can better and more efficiently support client flows.I think that will be very -- I think individual companies will make their own decisions in terms of where they have that from an advice driven perspective.So actually itâ€™s an interesting question. Two things that struck me as we sort of went through and thought about the quarter. One is the fact that when you look at allocations of investors in the retail space in terms of where their positions were in equities fixed income cash cash equivalents et cetera on a proportional basis. Over the last year or two actually those percentages have actually also remained relatively stable. So the retail investorsâ€™ investment is something that hasnâ€™t necessarily fluctuated based on the data that we have that we have seen. Those positions have remained there despite the fact that thereâ€™s been volatility. The second point is specifically on self-directed is the E*TRADE the fact that this is what I tried to mention in the script was where we are from the daily average trade levels still very very high 3 times the high from when E*TRADE was a standalone company. And so I think it highlights the change that we have seen in the retail sentiment over the course of the last two years or three years.I think that this is really based on the advice driven model right? You have uncertainty in Europe. Thereâ€™s a lot going on. Obviously there are pieces of commodities for example itâ€™s very specific. But then you also just see client engagement as it relates to various parts of Europe and being able to service that advice is all part of this diversified model.Absolutely. I am actually glad you asked the question. I think itâ€™s a really interesting space and I think itâ€™s an example of connecting the dots. So over the course of the last couple of years what we have realized is thereâ€™s a need for family offices to have access to services that we already offer Institutional Securities clients through our Fund Services platform. And so bringing together those conversations between whatâ€™s happening in the Institutional Securities Group and what strategy we are driving in Wealth Management is just an example of how the business is working more closely together to find those opportunities to service clients as family offices begin to feel more like Institutional accounts and that back and forth in dialogue is really amongst the team the leadership and then throughout the organization.Absolutely. As you know we are obviously offering some -- we have some offerings for different qualified investors that we have. But in this space we are obviously taking the lead from regulators as it relates to what we can and canâ€™t offer various clients.,0.170733064,0.338907659,0.168174595
67,67,LMT,Taiclet:,Yes. And remember during the negotiation period we've had significant changes in the underlying cost factors of bidding for the next three lots. And again those -- it was concurrent. So yes we've been going at this for a number of quarters but that's because that cost baseline has been moving during that time and we both have to agree on where we think it's going to end up. And so COVID impacts was cited and inflation which is even a more recent phenomenon so to speak. We've got to go all the way back to our supply chain see what the impacts are going to be then present that to the government. They have to vet those estimates and those cost assumptions. And that's what the basis of the negotiation to follow. So this has been longer than normal because the underlying ground has been shifting on the most important assumptions that go into the negotiation. We are going to stay with our strategy which is constructive which they are and progressing negotiations on the basis of actual cost information and data that provides our shareholders a fair margin and return as well as a government attractive contract.I can start with the theory and turn it over to Jay for the practice. The theory I have on capital deployment is whatâ€™s some highest and best use every quarter of the dollars that are created by the company or that we could or should be borrowing from the capital markets. And the batting order for me here kind of continues from my prior experience which is based on regression data on when we make decisions how they turn out. And what's the best ROIC that we can expect for a given dollar of investment or a given $100 million of investment? It tends to have been in my experience in both this and other companies that capital investments based on actual or anticipated contracts with real customers tend to have the highest ROICs. And we've bolstered our CapEx budget and plans under John's leadership and now Jay's as well at Lockheed Martin because we've got good prospects for contracts we're winning that are going into production that we need to invest in. The other thing we've done and really stepped up our internal spending on and we expect to get good returns from is our digital transformation program which I would say really is in the major leads right now frankly. We've got a great CIO running it. She's got a fantastic team. We have a well-thought-out plan. We have support from our Board to go do this on a multiyear basis. And it's going to make us more efficient more competitive and higher quality products coming out of our plants. So those are -- that's the first area. Our highest ROIC tends to be in universe so to speak. Second area I found to be most beneficial is inorganic investments right? So we're looking at really hard now making investments in both the U.S. and other countries in technologies and programs we think are going to have duration and traction. And again some of those will be in the U.S. and some will be outside the U.S. I think you'll see us investing a little more by putting say let's call it boots on -- and brick-and-mortar on the ground and other countries than we have in the past because we expect those ROIs to be pretty compelling. When it comes down to what's left M&A tends to be the third in the batting order. That doesn't seem to be really wide open in our industry right now with the current administration. So we're going to then look to what else can we do and it's share repurchases the next thing in the batting order. And you've seen us step up to that as far as announcements and performance already this year. And if we've got excess capital and we are at a reasonable leverage level we'll go ahead and continue to buy back shares. And I'll let Jay talk about intrinsic value and how we weave that in. But we're going to put our capital to work the cash flow we generate and what we can borrow and maybe even lever up if those opportunities with high ROICs get bigger than we thought.Sure. Well we've got as you've seen a lot of success on the F-35. We also have international F-16 interest that's increasing. CH-53K is on the table in say Germany for example. So there's an across-the-board interest in these products THAAD and PAC-3. Middle East has got to defend itself against missiles being fired at oil and gas infrastructure and even worse for populated major cities. And so those kind of products have high demand in that part of the world and others as well.Sure Matt. The first one is just the transfer of pension what you've seen us do over the last few years. This is essentially matching assets and liabilities and having insurance transferring these over to insurance companies from a liability management perspective. And so we're contemplating doing another round of those. On the debt it's just a matter of taking multiple years of debt and really refinancing that out just a little bit earlier than waiting for the maturities to occur in each particular year. And so those may have some P&L impacts associated with them. Last year we had a pretty sizable impact on the pension liability transfer I don't have that in front of me. We're still working through that right now. But just to say that those may happen here as early as in the second quarter just to give you the heads up about that.Sure Pete. Look I'd like just to go back to the environment we're in. I think it's pretty evident leadership in Congress and the key committees of course are well aware of this environment. And they have points of view on what the defense budget ought to look like to meet that environment and then the specifics underneath that. So for me to get ahead of them at this point is really not our place. But if you look in historical terms recent or beyond Congress does have a point of view in these matters and tends to take their own actions because they are the authorizers and appropriators at the end of the day and they'll have a voice. But I can't predict what that outcome is going to be in a quantitative fashion yet.Sure Rob. I mean my personal view of this having been an aviator in military myself is that you can't really have an effective economy and protect human rights if authoritarian governments are not constrained in what they might do and how they might do it frankly. So I would put that national security and human security notion up equally with other ESG topics like corporate governance and global warming climate change which are also very important. But I'd put it in the same category. I recognize in Europe that before Ukraine occurred that that was not necessarily the trend. But we've seen some increased interest from our international investors around the world because I think people are starting to recognize that this is not an anti-ESG industry. You could call it neutral or positive perhaps. But we're trying to maintain the conditions where people can live safe happy lives and the economy can flourish especially a free market economy.I'm not sure a regional approach is the right way to look at it. We've got demand signals for THAAD and PAC-3 from around the world because again countries everywhere are recognizing that especially when you see missiles hitting hospitals and situations like that and train stations in Ukraine that it's worthwhile to have an effective missile defense capacity in your country. So we are getting signals that if anything we might have to increase capacity in certain products to meet the global demand. So I'm not sure the regional approach is the best way to look at it. And by the way that threat hasn't gone down either it's getting greater instead of lesser based on what Iran tends to do in that part of the world.Without the data to quantify it Doug you kind of -- I'm a little bit data-driven first. I don't want to speculate on that. But directionally it sounds something that could come about frankly. We would expect it in a way but to quantify it a little too soon.Sure. I'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire Lockheed Martin team all 114 000 people strong for their contributions and dedication especially over the last many months where COVID reemerged in the winter and we still had production to get done and they did it. Our workforce has performed with the resilience under a lot of challenging circumstances for a long time. And through their ongoing efforts and commitment our company is now positioned to deliver outstanding technology and solutions for our customers and long-term value to our shareholders. So I want to thank you all again for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July.,0.002858341,0.00310111,0.000142137
68,68,SYK,Lobo:,Yes. That's a tough question. I mean I think I don't have a crystal ball. What I do have is I can see what we have prebought in our inventory. I do have the input from our suppliers and how they are looking at that sort of chip availability. And I also see the amount of activity that we have currently ongoing in terms of buying in that spot market. And I would tell you that Q2 is probably going to look pretty similar to Q1 in terms of that kind of pressure. But I am building up inventories and I'm building up component inventories. And so I expect it to ease a little bit as I look at Q3 and Q4. And I think right now that's the best I can do in terms of sort of eyeballing in where I think the impact of that will be in the P&L and also in terms of where our guidance has come in. I think we didn't lower our guidance from Q -- from January because we still saw a pathway to get within this guidance based on the activity we're seeing now.Yes. Look I still think this is a fabulous market long term. There's just no question. It's a great market. We had a tough comp -- there also was a bit of competitive activity in the U.S. in the ischemic side of the business. We see this from time to time from quarter-to-quarter. So we certainly weren't expecting double-digit growth in the U.S. It was a little lower than we expected because of the competitive activity but nothing too alarming. And we will have a very strong year. We're going to have a double-digit growth year in neurovascular globally and the U.S. will pick up in Q2 Q3 and Q4. So it's still a great market. We're only treating a small fraction of the patients that have stroke today. And for that reason with the pipeline and the great leadership team that we have over there in Neurovascular I know that this is going to be a very good long-term business.Well I think the pressure that's being put on the health care system and particularly nurses was obviously very acute during the pandemic. And with the shortages that are out there right now hospitals are looking for solutions that are going to help keep their nurses engaged help ensure that their errors aren't being made in the hospital improved workflow so I think our timing is perfect and that Vocera should be able -- this is a tailwind that's not over. I think this tailwind will continue to last for the next couple of years because it does provide really a reduced cognitive load for nurses. It makes their jobs easier. They're much happier when we have Vocera in their hospitals. So we're really excited. We think our timing is really ideal and this is a multiyear tailwind.Yes. I mean at this point I would say there's no -- we're obviously not giving guidance on 2023. But in terms of those products still early Q guidance not is still in the approval process. So we still have a ways to go there. But in terms of the next power tools also similar we're still early in terms of getting that out from a launch standpoint next year. So at this point no update in terms of major impacts or expectations to what it might have on our numbers for next year.Yes. So what I'd say is Insignia product is ideal for direct interior which of course is very popular in the ASCs. But not just in the ASCs also in the hospital. And even though we only launched it very recently the feedback has been incredibly positive. And so we have a great design for the product. Surgeons are finding it terrific approaching the offsets the sizes the fit that it's really delivering on what we thought. So we couldn't be happier with the launch at least this initial phase of the launch. And this will be a tailwind for our Hip business and it will actually pick up as more and more sets are deployed in the field you'll see it actually accelerate through Q3 Q4 and into next year.Yes. On your second question around the spine market versus hip and knee market even if you go back to pre-pandemic the hip and knee market was growing on a dollar basis was growing faster than the spine market. And the spine market did have some elements of the more acute procedures that were less deferrable. And so it didn't decline nearly as much as the hip and knee business did. So not as much of a decline. And then therefore not as much of a pickup in a market that frankly hasn't been historically growing quite as fast as Hips and Knees. So those are the dynamics I think that you're seeing play out here. We're delighted with our performance certainly in our -- if you look at our Knee business and Hips just this quarter we were leading the market in Knees for a long time. Mako has been an enormous driver. Our cementless procedures are roughly 1 out of every 2 knees in the United States are going in cementless. So we have a real competitive advantage that you're seeing play out with our Knee number but excited that our Hip number is now moving up as well. But I'm not surprised to see those growing faster than the Spine business. We'll have to see when everyone else reports how the markets played out. But to me it's not that surprising.Yes. Look given the inflationary environment as Preston mentioned earlier we are obviously going to look at pricing actions across our portfolio. In some places it's going to be easier than other places given the nature of our contracts. But for competitive reasons we're really not going to disclose the tactics the strategies which products. Every quarter you see we do report our price you'll get to see the overall impact but it's not something we're really -- I'm going to get into on this call.So thank you all for joining our call. We look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you in July. Thank you.,0.003210266,0.003428578,0.00016287
69,69,BKNG,Fogel:,David you want to do that first one?And Brian talking about connected trip. So connected trip is a long term vision. And it's going to take some time before we get to where I believe we need to be in terms of a truly step functional change in the way people are currently by exploring going through travel I think we all know how difficult it is. And we all know that it should be better. So that's the goal down the road. In 2023 we're still going to be pretty early in this I think I would think it's we're still in the base level of just getting great verticals up and running so that they by themselves are fantastic good product for people to use. And then just the basic-cross selling things that we think is a first step to get towards that connected trip. And if you ask me one of the biggest things for 2023. Well the things I just talked about right now flights right now I really liked the fact again the new customers coming in and they're coming in they're buying a meaningful number of buyer combinations. And we haven't optimized this yet. That's something important. Then on top of that I mentioned in my prepared remarks about just beginning small experiments with other types of verticals and how putting these things together can give a better experience to a customer. The great thing about these things is trying to build a belief that coming to us to Booking.com is the best way to go. So getting more repeat business and getting this do it on the app so that we don't pay for that person to come and increase that loyalty. So there's a lot of ways trying to increase this flywheel. So people know the products better and coming to us. And as we continue to do that get more information be able to provide a better proposal to them a better offer to them that they can work more easily. And it continues to build on its own. It's going to take time though. And in 2023 I don't think you're going to see huge numbers from all things I just talked about. But you will see incremental improvement.So let me tell you in general and David I'm not sure you want to talk in terms of any sort of numbers and levers or whatever. But yes we are very pleased with what we're seeing. But I believe it's a combination of many things that we're working on is really is a game of execution in the small details means you're working with partners and getting the right price the right inventory. And then it's making sure we're showing it to the customer at the right time in the right way. And it means also doing things we're talking about with alternative accommodations bring in a few bringing in some incremental more supply there making sure we're working to come up with ways that works better so that the customers having a better experience and their payments are more smooth et cetera. I can go through a lot of little things that we're working on. And each one builds on its own. It makes it a better experience. Now yes we have a brand effort in the US as you hopefully remember back from our Super Bowl we I believe a very good ad and we're continuing this is not just a one and done. It's a campaign. And we tie that with some efforts in social and we're doing a lot of different things to try to increase our awareness getting that top of mind awareness in the US for example helping build that. But this is a global effort really in terms of trying to build our business by doing all the little things that make it a better product because in the long run the better product is what's going to win. And David I donâ€™t know if you want to speak anything specific in terms of ROIs or levers right there and nature.Dave why donâ€™t you take that? And Iâ€™ll just turn my [indiscernible]â€¦David I think we don't reveal that granularity.Yes and I'd just say look I'm very pleased with what we've done over the last 2.5 years since this pandemic started. What we've been doing in building out our business in the US and I made the point of how important was strategically to do better in the US because we had been under indexed in the US. And we've been doing a lot of blocking tackling over these 2.5 years in the midst of this pandemic. And we're beginning to see it come through and I'm very pleased with the results up through Q1.Do you want me to go first? So Mark here's the thing. I have seen over two decades people have been talking about a connecting trip because travel in this problem since we started buying travel online and no human being do it for us. Certainly the technological landscape has changed significantly since we first started doing this when I first joined this company in 2000. And now we have so many new things that we can use to make this better the idea of mobile apps but even more so all the machine learning AI to be able to do better types of predictability. What's happening what can be better for a person how we can see is there a potential problem in the future we can fix it before it happens. So many things I believe this can be done will be done and we are the ones we're going to do. Okay but we're not there yet. So to say it hasn't happened it hasn't happened yet. Because we've been built all this yet. I believe it will happen. And I do believe it's necessary because I don't believe that people should have to suffer the way they do right now in trying to do a simple family trip. That being said though it is going to take time we're going to get there. But we're not going to show up next quarter or the next year to say here's the incredible increase in our business it is going to be incremental. It's going to take time but I absolutely believe this is where it's going to be. And David Iâ€™ll let you take yours.Sure. So may be talk a little bit about trying to build our supply areas where we think we need it. And I've talked about this in the past in the alternative accommodations area where we think we are not as well positioned as some of our competitors stating the fact particularly in the US so we absolutely need to go out. And firstly sure we got a product that people own properties want to put on our platform. That's kind of the new things I talked about in terms of the liability insurance in terms of payment system that is actually workable and works well even that. But then we have to make people aware of this. And that's going out we mentioned we have a new campaign out we're spending money. And it's more than just marketing out there. It's actually individuals talking with the big owners of multiple multiple properties make sure they understand what we can bring to them. That's how we start to bring in more of that because we don't have the supply. You've never becoming business. So we do that. And then we obviously have the second the other side of this two sided marketplace make sure that consumers are aware of this too and make sure they're coming to it. That's how we're going to do this over time. And it's obviously something that I've been talking about for a long time I'm sure people will get a little tired of me saying it. But it's this is where we're going. I mentioned how we are we did have a net increase in alternative accommodations very pleased about that. And we are going to keep on building this. And it builds on itself. This is again it's one of those things where it's like a snowball and you need to get it rolling. And then it will build more and more faster and faster. It's going to take some time. I'm pleased with where it is in terms of the window and may repeat that part of the question.Yes so right now we're not seeing any shortage of supply from demand people come in and it's not so they're not -- they can't find anything [Indiscernible] or the rates right now. That doesn't mean and peak summer that there won't be some shortages of inventory. But that happens every normal year when there's peak summer travel in the northern hemisphere. The most popular places will fill up and most popular low key -- and most low key properties in most popular locations are going to fill up. One of the great things that we've been doing for some time is being very flexible in offering customers when they come in and we're not having enough inventory we think because things are filled up there. We're offering an alternative place that they could go and stay or different locations to your property all different ways. We are doing so working more different experiments to do that. But we're not the only one to do that. That's important. You have a customer in your store you want to sell them you don't have enough of what they want you show them something else that probably he is just like that's what we're doing. Clearly over time what I want to do though is not have to have this conversation about the US that we don't have enough of the single properties on the beach and XYZ. And that's something that really what we're working on but right now I don't see an issue right now we're having insufficient supply.You got Dave start.You start.And David you basically said what I was going to say basically we have a situation that is very tied somewhat to restrictions and is countries that are typical long haul destinations some of them in Asia for example as they'll begin to lighten up and feel more confident they can go without having to do a lot of different things don't have to quarantine before don't have to go to get a test they have done test before as these things go away then people will travel more and more of these long haul trips. So I definitely and positive on the continued trend in this area.Okay. Was that the final question?Okay thank you. As always I want to thank our partners but I really want to thank all of our partners who have generously contributed to our refugee platform. Also of course want back to customers our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long term vision for our company. Thank you all and good night.,0.003011644,0.003276289,0.000203653
70,70,BLK,Fink:,Hi Dan.So we are having dialog with pension funds worldwide on this with insurance companies worldwide. Because of comprehensiveness of our investment platform because of Aladdin we provide a unique position with all these companies in terms of outsourcing whether itâ€™s part of a general kind of an insurance company or the entire pension fund. We announced last year whatâ€™s our big win with British share in the UK. Weâ€™re having many conversations right now with other pension funds. Weâ€™re looking to see what -- how BlackRock can help them achieve their long-term goals and aspirations. Weâ€™re working with many insurance companies and see can we provide them with better support better investment opportunities and they can leverage our team with maybe their existing team and manage a part of their portfolios together. So the conversations are probably more robust. Thereâ€™s probably more opportunities across pension funds and insurance comes at any time in our history and we look at weâ€™re as well-positioned as any firm in the world on it. Rob do you have anything more to say on that?Hey MikeLet me just add one more point. As I said in my prepared remarks the interconnectivity between sustainable investing and infrastructure is going to be enormous whether it is a pipeline in Saudi Arabia or a pipeline from Texas to Mexico or investing in the sequestration of hydrocarbons and H2O in the Midwest of the United States. The building out of new renewable platforms of charging stations. Across the board the conversations weâ€™re having with new innovative companies in technology and the robustness of our conversations with the largest energy companies in the world our connectivity in this space has never been greater. And I would say with high confidence and high conviction the opportunities to place a lot of money in very unique investment opportunities in this interconnectivity sustainability and infrastructure is going to be large and itâ€™s going to be multiple years of investing.Hi Brian.As I said weâ€™re in large dialogues with the traditional hydrocarbon companies energy companies. Weâ€™ve had numerous conversations with the leaders of every energy company in the world about how theyâ€™re moving forward. I think the geopolitical issues as you framed the question is going to spur a huge amount of investing huge amount of investing in the exploration and development more oil but at the same time elevated energy prices is going to accelerate decarbonization technology. And I think what youâ€™re seeing whether itâ€™s the $1 trillion investment in infrastructure that the United States voted for last year and now the real commitment out of Europe to build LNG plants to have less dependency on one supply chain Russian gas I believe in our conversations even at country levels are very large and how can they create multiple supply chains for energy. And that is a combination of decarbonization technology and a combination of insurances of having energy to meet the needs of society. So all of this is going to be -- itâ€™s just a long-term project. Itâ€™s not going to be a straight line as my lenders wrote about. Any energy transition has to be fair and just or it doesnâ€™t work. We are witnessing that now the supply shocks and now excess demand and so all of this is playing out that itâ€™s going to create an investment boom the combination of fiscal spending on the US part the European part. We had -- as in every country we have conversations about decarbonization or the utilization of hydrogen. I was in Japan last week a lot of conversations on hydrogen and what role can that play in Japan. Two trips to the Middle East more conversations about -- as they move with a lot of sun and solar moving more towards more renewables the movement away from oil as they utilize a lot of oil for power production in Saudi Arabia to move to gas so moving from dark brown light brown. All of this is just going to stimulate a lot of excess demand for product and supply of product. And I would have said for the last few years a bigger issue is supply of product not demand. Then I do believe the supply quotient over the next few years is going to be larger which just means more and more opportunities. And we are -- in our forecast for new growth in these areas weâ€™re forecasting the build-out of three large infrastructure funds to meet these needs.Well first of all great question very timely especially with the rising energy prices and all the issues of supply shocks in hydrocarbons. In all my letters I said an energy transition is not a straight line. Itâ€™s a 30 to 50-year time frame for us to move that forward. Itâ€™s not today. Itâ€™s not tomorrow. And the key is making sure that we have energy transition that fills the needs of all societies and higher energy prices really crushes emerging markets and harms -- the poor in every country that is dependent a higher percentage of their disposable income that goes to energy. And obviously you couple that with food inflation it has a severe impact. Does that change the long-term nature of ESG or as I think youâ€™re framing it more or on the sustainability side? Not really because weâ€™re going to -- we always said weâ€™re going to have to invest in new technologies to bring down that green premium. Well the green premium obviously is reduced with higher energy cost today but we still have that green premium in a lot of the technologies. A lot of this is just going to take quite a bit of flow at the time. But if you just look at the evidence of our first quarter we had about $19 billion of sustainable flows. Obviously thatâ€™s down from prior quarters but certainly up from two years ago. Much of it was an active strategy. So as I talked about what weâ€™re trying to do in the alternatives space $8 billion was in ETFs. So Iâ€™m not going to respond to any one quarter valuation. Of course in quarters where you have rising energy prices energy companies and we would -- theyâ€™ve done fantastically well as they should be. They were cheap they were undervalued. They were trading below book in many cases and how the market has come to appreciate much of that. As you know also Iâ€™ve always said I donâ€™t believe in divestiture. BlackRock has over $180 billion in investments in this. So we are working with all the companies about how to move forward. And so in terms of a one quarter return on one product versus another let me be clear most investors are not doing this for a quarter or even a year. These are long-term views on the movement towards more of a decarbonization future of the world and that doesnâ€™t change anything now. We have rising energy prices from energy shocks. Itâ€™s very harmful for society and governments are responding. In Europe youâ€™re seeing many governments putting caps on energy prices because it really harms their populate. So this is a really complex difficult issue but I donâ€™t think it changes anything in the long-term. And let me be clear BlackRock is the largest investor for pension funds and retirements than anyone. We have a long-term responsibility in making sure over the long run that our beneficiaries to achieve their long-term aspirations and goals. And so thereâ€™s no question this energy transition is real. But itâ€™s going to be not a straight line.Thank you operator. Once again I want to thank everybody for your continued interest in BlackRock. I strongly believe our first quarter performance is a direct results of our commitment and our deep commitment to our clients as I said just a minute ago and our desire investing for them over the long-term ahead of their needs. We see tremendous opportunities ahead of us and BlackRock has focused to be remaining and working with all our people working with all the communities where we operate and working in a comprehensive way as we try to stay in front of the clientsâ€™ needs. If we continue to stay in front of the clientsâ€™ needs if we continue to be a voice of long-term investors I believe we will continue to deliver those durable returns that all of you our shareholders expect from us and that is our commitment to you. Everyone have a good quarter.,0.003173843,0.003902435,0.000446314
71,71,AXP,Squeri:,Well as I said earlier we are always in terms of our guidance planning for macroeconomic consensus as while also making sure we're thinking about other possibilities. And certainly Bill is just one example. We are doing work today and making adjustments on the risk management side as we think about what the impact is of sustained levels of inflation at its current level on different aspects of our customer base because we want to make sure we're positioned from a risk perspective for that. Although that is not the macroeconomic consensus. years again our ability to be agile and manage through a downturn should that happen. And we're trying to strike all those same balances right now.Well I think the way you got to think about both of these is we are constantly and continuously adding more benefits and more services to the card. When you look at both of those partnerships they onto themselves they do not have top line growth. What they do do though is they in our mind drive more engagement drive more retention and give people more reason to want to be with the card. Now I'll just talk about resi for a second. Resi is not only a vehicle for giving our card members access to restaurant reservations and card members do get access to the global dining program but it's also a card acquisition vehicle as well because resi is an open platform. And so resi was all about where our card members spend their money and how we can integrate more with restaurants and connect our card members and really take advantage of our closed loop in a different way not just for payments but the reservation piece and then which leads to payments. And so when you look at the partnerships that we have that are sort of around the core of the card. And I'm not talking about the Delta co-brand partnerships and so forth. But when you look at the other things that we do add on what we're constantly adding to our products are more services better access more experiences and so forth so that you continue to build the value propositions in different and more sustainable ways. And Vanguard is an example of offering an investment service opportunity for card members that want to take advantage of it that combines Vanguard's digital adviser service with the personal adviser service and puts an NMR component into it. And so we'll continue to look at other lifestyle financial and travel and entertainment services that just add to the overall underlying value of our card products.Hey Ryan.Well let me answer questions one and three Jeff can answer two. So -- if I remember one and three. But look the reality is that we continue to see good opportunities. And as those opportunities continue to arise we'll continue to invest in them. What's important to know is that well when we make an investment we're making those investments through the cycle. So as we underwrite ROIs -- as we underwrite and we look at ROIs we feel good about what we see. Now why those opportunities presenting themselves? Well I think for a couple of reasons. Number one I think the premium card space has been expanding. I think especially as you think about Gen Zs coming into the workforce. I think about Millennials which are getting a little bit older now but Millennials who are still gravitating to the product. So the opportunities have risen I think because the pool for our product has been getting bigger and bigger. And we've talked about this in the past. When we used to look at people coming into our franchise we used to start them off on fee-free cards. Well a lot of our fee-free cards are probably not as differentiated as some of the others. And we have better service and so forth. But when you look at the value of the products or the fee product the fee products that we're offering a smart consumer and a smart small business person can really generate a lot more value out of those products than they're paying for the card. And as you know with our value propositions given our partner network we work with our partners to provide value to our card members and it all works out for all three of us the Card Member the partner and for us. I think the other thing that's important and you've seen a growth in small business acquisition as well is more and more small businesses are forming and that's one of the structural shifts that we are taking advantage of. And to get to the third question and Jeff can get to the second question which if he remembers it at this point. But to get to your third one will we take -- if credit continues to perform better we release more reserves will we take advantage of opportunities. We will continue to take advantage of those opportunities as they present themselves. As I said we're running this for the medium to long-term and it really is irresponsible in my opinion of me to pass up really good investment opportunities that will pay off over the longer-term. I think one of the things that you've seen this year is look we're committing to 18% to 20% revenue growth off of a -- basically off of a 2019 revenue base. And you've never seen that from us before. And that is a direct result of us investing in our card members investing in our brand and not walking away from good investment opportunities.Good morning Meng.Well I mean look we -- this is a competitive space. When you're talking about U.S. consumer it's a competitive space. It's always been a competitive space. And it will continue to be a competitive space. And you've got Capital One out there with the new product and JPMorgan all terrific companies that are looking to double down on the premium side of it and we'll continue to -- again going back to what I said when we -- the question was asked about resi and Vanguard and so forth we're going to continue to add value to the products and making sure that we are still top of mind and top of wallet. And that -- look we had record acquisitions. However it's still a competitive space. When you think about competition though we just don't think about competition in the US Consumer we also think about it in the US small business and which is competitive as well. And you can go market by market by market both from a small business perspective. And so there is a lot of competition out there. We keep our eye on the competition and our objective is to continue to understand what our customer needs are understand where our customer needs are going and continue to develop our products and services. And the reality is you just don't -- you don't launch a product and then go to sleep for a few years and then say okay in three years we'll come up with a new one. We're constantly adding value. And I think you saw that as we added more value to the Platinum Card even after the refresh when we put the Walmart Plus benefit on. So we always assume high competition and we always assume that the competition is really good. And that has served us well having that mindset on running the business.No that's a real good call out. And remember that virtuous cycle sits on top of an actual network right? Because where we get those partners from are from our network our merchant network. And so you have this physical merchant network and we're able to create that flywheel to drive more and more value not only to card members but to partners and the more -- as Jeff said the more cardholders you have and the more value our customers get it the more they want to invest in that base.Good morning Chris.No. So -- yes it's good question Chris. As I pointed out earlier the -- and as I think I showed a chart at Investor Day the majority of the growth in net card fees is driven by bringing more customers into the high fee-paying products not by any particular price increase although the price increases when we price for adding value to add a little bit. When you think about the rate at which we've been bringing new premium card members into the franchise record first quarter for US Platinum Gold on the consumer side and business Platinum. That mechanically now just makes me pretty darn confident that as you look at the next few quarters that 16% is likely to even further accelerate a little bit as we build on the acquisition momentum we have. Because as I think it sounds like you recall the accounting for fees you're amortizing of over 12 months from when they're paid. So there's a fairly predictable effect here.Well I think that the very careful word that I inserted Rick when we talked about sequential growth was in what we're calling core earnings which is why we included that pre-tax pre-provision net income number on the first page because credit reserves are going to bounce over the place. Although in terms of dollars I would credit reserves at the end of the year assuming AR continues to grow as we expect to be a little bit higher. So I absolutely do expect pre-tax pre-provision net income to be a little bit stronger each quarter as you go through the year. I don't expect that necessarily of GAAP earnings per share because we just had really we pulled forward in many ways a good sized credit reserve release into Q1 that drove your GAAP EPS up to 270. Clearly I do not expect sequential growth of that number if you just do the simple math. That's pretty obvious given our EPS guidance. The other point I'd come back to is we feel really good about the revenue momentum but boy Steve I think has made very clear our focus on pursuing good investment opportunities when they arise. And so we're very comfortable with the EPS guidance we've given for the year.Hi Lisa.Yes. I mean look I think we are seeing a little bit of a higher ROI on our card acquisition spending. And as I â€“ as we said I think there's just there's an expanding pool. It's not just the consumer base but it's also the small business base. I'll go back to my comments before. The millennial and Gen Z pool is expanding. There are more small businesses out there. And as we look at the opportunities we were able to bring in probably more cards than we thought we were in the first quarter. And we see opportunities going forward. So we'll continue to invest to grow the card base. And â€“ but remember what we're looking at we're just not looking to grow in cards. I mean these cards are hitting our return. You've got a large percentage of these cards are fee-paying cards. But I'll also go back to â€“ I think it's either my comments or in the Jeff script 60% of the cards that we did acquire from a consumer perspective were millennial cards which are up 50 -- which is -- was 50% pre-pandemic. So is a bigger pool for us to acquire from from a millennial Gen Z perspective and there are small businesses. So right now we feel good about card growth. How that translates next quarter. Look the last few quarters we've had sequential card growth quarter-to-quarter. And coming off last year look there wasn't a tremendous amount of card growth in the first quarter from a relative basis on a comparative basis but it continued to move up every single quarter. And we feel good about what happened this particular quarter. Can it be 6% again next quarter? I don't really know.So just -- I'm sorry just one other point. Just retention helps a lot. And our retention numbers if you look at the last couple of years have improved significantly. So if you think about your base is having a leak in it the leak got a lot smaller. So that's -- I think that's important. Don as far as fintechs go I think there's some opportunities for us and I think the partnership with I2C -- we already have a partnership with them in Latin America. And I think this will just make it easy to onboard fintechs that want to have American Express because the reality is a lot of them -- not a lot of most of them don't do their own processing they'll partner with somebody else to do this. And having I2C and being able now to do this on a global basis will enable us to approach. I don't look at that as a necessarily a threat. I look at this as an opportunity for us. And what was the first part of your question Don? Cap One no limit. I don't know what no limit. I really don't know what no limit is. And so -- yes I think what they've done is put out a no preset spending limit but -- and I'm not being flipping here I just don't know what that no preset spending limit is. So we'll see how that plays out. Again a really good company. It had lots and lots of success very tough competitor. They're the first ones to go down this road and we'll see how it all plays out how it all plays out. But we take them very seriously as we take everybody else. Yes it is part of our secret sauce and we'll see. So again just look at the results in the first quarter for us we had 30% growth from a small business perspective. So we feel pretty good about small business at this point.Acquisition yes.,0.0029715,0.003188312,0.000137066
72,72,MDLZ,Zaramella:,It is another $0.10 of cost headwind as we -- as I said in -- to the reply to John between the Ukrainian business laws and the revenue that came out of the plant last year in the Ukraine and the additional cost pressure driven by the Ukraine war I see another $0.10. And so between the two it is $0.13 of EPS. Now as I said the high single digits quite frankly at this point is predicated on elasticity. The elasticityâ€™s are better than what we have baked into the forecast it will be high single-digit EPS if elasticityâ€™s are more in line with historical levels of one plus then I think we will have a little bit lower than high single-digit EPS growth.Yeah it is all included in there.Welcome.Hi Bryan.No don't read too much into that. Obviously we are expecting OI dollar growth throughout the quarters. We have to see how cost evolves throughout the quarters because as I said we have baked into the forecast the current cost levels. We are pretty much well covered for commodities for the remainder of the year. So at this point I would say yes that's the idea depending as I said a few times on elasticity there might be some bumps in the road but that's the plan at the moment.The -- that is factored into the plan. I have to say at this exact moment in time. Clearly we are facing some shortages but they have no been a material impact yet to the business. So the plan in terms we have is extra cost will get us the commodities we need. You might have heard about the palm oil issue in Indonesia. That one for us is not a material issue at this point in time. We are clearly monitoring the situation very closely. In terms of wheat the wheat coming out of the Ukraine is mostly going into the Middle East and North Africa for us. As I said in the last call the total wheat we procure for the company is $600 million $700 million. So in the big scheme of things we believe that in total wheat is not going to be a material problem in terms of supply. It hasn't been yet but we have to see how the crop evolves and what can still be sourced out of the Ukraine particularly for our Middle East and North African business.We are facing some issues on specific items but the issues are not broad-based. Paper and -- particularly in places like Asia it is under a lot of pressure at this point. But again in terms of supply we have some issues here and there but nothing that racks up to a material number for the company yet. And I hope it stays that that way.Thank you.The level of inflation it is higher in Q1 for obvious reasons because you know that last year the inflation picked up materially towards the second part of the year. And it caught us a little bit by surprise the level that we saw in the second part of the year. And obviously the level of gross margin in Q1 is reflective of three key elements. One it is the additional pricing. When you look for instance at the US business you clearly see a level of revenue that is 8% with a modest volume mix impact which means there is 8% pricing kicking in in there. The second element is the fact that there is good volume growth in Q1 that provides leverage. And the third level is the protection in terms of hedges that we put in place in terms of commodities and ForEx. So as you think about inflation going down in the remainder part of the year it will go down year-on-year but the level is still going to be higher in terms of absolute dollars and we will have to price accordingly. The volume might not be as high as the 4% that you saw in Q1. And so that will have a play into the gross margin evolution over the quarter. So I think assuming that you're going to see an 80 basis point decline given all the pricing we are about to take might not be necessarily realistic. The goal that we have though is that we want to enter 2023 with the level of pricing at current commodity and ForEx cost that allows us to have a level of -- is more aligned to historical levels.Hi Jason.Okay. So the DSD is an own system. The -- there are some contact points between the current beam of network and the Ricolino. So one of the things we will have to do is to carve out and create a little bit of additional infrastructure on our side but nothing at this point I would say that is worrisome. I feel quite good about the reach that Ricolino is going to have with 2 100 DSD route achieving 440 000 moms-and-pops which is really where when you look at our biscuit business in Mexico being at 5% share of total market the opportunity lies. And on the other side our Mexico sales complement the strong model trade presence with our some modern trade presence what Ricolino has. And we feel like between revenue and cost synergies this is going to be a material enhancement to the value of Mondelez. And so we are very very excited. On top of that the brands are very strong. And as Dirk said particularly in the US we see tremendous opportunities in pushing this brand through what is a cohort that is growing and has tremendous potential.Hi.Look in total for the company the mix component is very very neutral. It hasn't been a problem. It hasn't been an upside either. And the simple way you have to think about it is North America is one of the most profitable operations that we have. And as we address the question of Andrew Lazar Dirk said that the new businesses that we acquired are up while our biscuit business in terms of volume is still below last year. And one of the reasons why that this is A we are lapping clearly tremendous growth last year in terms of volume. But also as I look closely to the numbers the supply-related issues that we have are causing still quite a bit of volume track compared to what it could be otherwise. On the flip side as you saw gum is growing very very healthily as a category gum can be I think 27% and that number obviously is mix accretive. The other one that is mix accretive it is about world travel retail which is picking up nicely quarter-after-quarter albeit it is not still at the level it is not yet at the level before the pandemic. So these are the three key mix components North America volume being down because of supply chain issues gum being up and world travel retail being up all the rest in terms of mix I would say fairly neutral in its totality and these three elements offset each other.Look let's stay tuned. The -- at this point I feel that we have what it takes to be able to fund the $2 billion of buybacks. I'll provide a little bit more color around this at our Investor Day.Thank you.Hey Alexia.Thank you everyone.,0.002847865,0.00342834,0.000339328
73,73,GILD,O'Day:,Yes. Thanks Geoff. Appreciate it. I'm going to turn it over to Merdad in a second here. But just remind -- for those of you that didn't have the chance to look at the virology deep dive day we really did spend a lot of time in the entirety of the portfolio and the many shots on goal we have along with lenacapavir. Lenacapavir is a truly unique molecule and presents opportunities and challenges to find exactly the right partner. But we certainly have many that will be progressing to the clinic. But Merdad maybe you want to give a little more meat to the...Yes. Thanks Do. We're delighted to have Christi here with us. So we'll hear it from the source here. Over to you Christi.Thanks for the question. Merdad why don't you cover that?Thanks Robyn and I'll start and then maybe Andy can add. But I appreciate you bringing that up. I think it's been a really purposeful strategic approach that we've taken over the past -- last 3 years to build our oncology portfolio beyond cell therapy which is obviously now has a history with us for almost 5 years. And I'd just remind the folks on the phone that in addition to whatever is acquired at the time of the acquisition in terms of trials and potential and capability of that size organization naturally when a large organization acquires particularly these pan-tumor potential molecules you begin really the process of extending the potential for that medicine alone in late lines earlier lines and in combinations and thoughtful combinations. I think actually Kite is a terrific example of that going back now 5 years post the acquisition and I appreciate Robyn that you started out with congratulations on Yescarta. But to see the potential for a technology like cell therapy and the leadership that Kite took by bringing this up into earlier lines of therapy and the number of patients of course then that you can impact on with a potentially curative therapy is exactly kind of the playbook that we will be -- we are pursuing right now with Trodelvy with magrolimab and obviously with the combination of Arcus assets which -- albeit a bit earlier in the process. So I think we always have to remember the time frame and which one evaluates the success of M&A. The other thing I would just say is that of course we constantly are looking to complement that. I mean the bar is much higher now for Gilead than it was several years ago because the number of possibilities and opportunities we have and the bandwidth that any one company can do but you see on the bandwidth side we're also doing a lot of collaborations with other companies including folks like Merck who are operationalizing in fact a study of ours with Trodelvy. So there's different ways I think to work on the bandwidth. But we will constantly be looking at different types of opportunities out there that complement our virology our oncology and our early inflammation program to add those to the growth story that we are creating here at Gilead. I'll just -- I know Andy spends a lot of time thinking about this. I'd love Andy's additional thoughts on this as well.Thanks Andy. And the last thing I'd say in addition to the molecules and the medicines the expertise that we're bringing into Gilead is second to none. And hopefully you saw some of that. And it's just really the -- some representation of that at both virology and oncology deep dive days because that's really critical in any company that we've all -- as the leadership team worked in is really getting the right teams together at the right time to make sure we're making the right choices and decisions on the portfolios as we move forward. So that's a really big focus for us and we're really pleased with the progress we're making there.Yes. Umer I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Merdad. So first of all I mean just to reinforce this message for everybody on the phone I mean we are absolutely moving with tremendous focus and speed. And of course we have great lessons within our organization. Remdesivir was arguably the fastest development of an antiviral that's ever occurred from standing still essentially to an approval in the United States. So -- and as you know we've got a lot of experience from that in terms of working both property groups around accelerating trials with the FDA around pursuing unique regulatory path. And those learnings and those lessons I just want to say are certainly being put to use now for 5 2 4 5. Having said that we're of course at a very different stage of the pandemic at this stage. And therefore both from a regulatory perspective and also our ability to recruit clinical trials particularly with a somewhat raining pandemic in the developed world has implications on the path we'll take. And with that maybe I'll turn it over to Merdad on any other details he wants to add.Yes. Thanks a lot Andy. I mean Evan I think the bottom line is that again we took a somewhat conservative approach in the absence of having regulatory discussions so far. We thought it was a prudent thing to do. And to Andy's point I mean this is an evaluation of value at the time of the transaction which of course several years later in terms of the indications the combinations the potential for Trodelvy is never as you know reflective in the initial accounting treatment of it. So hopefully there's plenty of information in there in our press release and more than happy to take it up with you as well. So thanks Evan for that.Thanks a lot Tyler. So over to Merdad please.Thanks Colin. Merdad go ahead.Thanks. Very nice conceptual there. So out of respect for everybody's time we'll take one last question. Jonathan can we have the last question please?With that I just want to thank everybody. I really appreciate the attention today for the couple of deep dives we've had. We look forward to chatting with you at ASCO and beyond to keep you updated on our progress for the year. And with that I'll turn it over to Jacquie for some final comments.,0.007797023,0.017954409,0.007186587
74,74,TJX,Herrman:,Europe and Canada.The freight.Freight. Yeah.So Kimberly at a high level the way you said that is the way that Iâ€™m -- look you can look at it that way this quarter though that if you had had. If we had had Europe and Canada on it we would have had a lot on the wash the differences. And Scott mentioned this we had such an overachievement on the sales that I mean youâ€™d have to be counting on a 16 open only comp sales and when the rest of Europe. If we have those type of comp sales yeah weâ€™d have a different discussion where maybe the margin is back to more like those levels. But that youâ€™d have to have these way outpaced comp sales like we just did. Now to your other point though and Scott mentioned it we are looking at the COVID cost it is something we can take a hard look at here in the near future as we move ahead each quarter and as the environment normalizes weâ€™re going to make some improvements on those lines. So that will help. So I hope that answered -- hope that answered. Weâ€™re -- we do believe thereâ€™s sales upside all along. And another plus we have on the cost line is our average retail has been moderating. And Scott I think started to allude to this as we go forward even into the back half weâ€™re looking like itâ€™s going to moderate even more because weâ€™re seeing some more best brands goods coming in on order as we get to the third quarter which is going to help our average ticket and that should help our expense on processing come down a little bit. So a very good question a lot of moving parts.Thank you.Yeah.Yeah. No. Great Paul. So standout categories Iâ€™ll start with the most obvious one which is our home business is remarkably consistent as I said in the script. I mean youâ€™re looking at 40 comps kind of what we did in the first quarter and again that basically was where we were in every division even in the full family stores in a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls up in Canada Homesense so remarkable consistency. And the neat thing there is we have a lot of broad-based consistency throughout our entire loan business. So whether itâ€™s big ticket areas like whether itâ€™s furnitures or rugs or decorative accessories everything was good. There wasnâ€™t really one category. And this is where I give our teams planning and allocation and this is not just in the home area. Our buying teams our planning and allocation teams have been getting the goods fueling it so that the second part of your question was the deceleration in home. We have really not seen it -- I donâ€™t think weâ€™re going to expect it to stay at that almost artificially high level than it did in the first quarter. But I think we have opportunity over the next quarter to stay up in the realm pretty close to that. And weâ€™re not having a problem in the home area of stock -- staying at stock which was the third part of your question and weâ€™re not actually having a problem where apparel has now started to improve for us. Paul I think youâ€™re asking what else is standing out. So we have a handful of apparel categories which I wonâ€™t give the specifics on which ones but they are really kicking in as the quarter went on and going into the second quarter. And the nice thing that often happens is when the weather shifts and apparel kicks in if there was a trend line prior usually our home business takes more of a hit where the consumer moves off of home for a little bit. And yeah again our homes is going to continue at 40 comps but it did not move off hardly at all. And our apparel just kicked in and thatâ€™s one reason youâ€™re seeing these outpaced comps from us really at this first quarter. Chasing product flow of product has been a non-issue. I say itâ€™s a non-issue because the teams have really executed so well and theyâ€™re working so -- and I give logistics credit. I give really everybody involved credit to keep fuel. Itâ€™s not easy to keep fueling a 16 comp and thatâ€™s why I liked your question when you asked it because it is an unusual time for us to be running an open only 16 comps. And I just again give credit to all The TJX associates that are involved in that. Because theyâ€™re making to happen they have this position going into the second quarter every bit as well as we were in the first quarter. Hopefully that answers your question.Thank you Paul.In third quarter and fourth quarter and to your point Ike as the world more normalizes. What weâ€™ve been trying to do is keep associate and customer safety still. I guess weâ€™ve looked at some of our -- and weâ€™ve talked about this we have the greeters at the front of our stores which have -- itâ€™s created a cost but itâ€™s also created a customer service improvement perception and the safety which is why we do believe that some of those extra costs have allowed us to play offense to actually drive our sales ironically. And so we are going to ease our way off and not just do a pendulum swing quick move because we believe itâ€™s been helping our topline. However we know we need to moderate on that and we will do it just like Scott said and weâ€™re going to take a hard look especially as you get to the third quarter and fourth quarter. So hopefully that -- I just want to give you some color on why we arenâ€™t going to necessarily move off it as fast because itâ€™s been a topline driver.Yeah. Great question. Yeah. So obviously when we looked at the first quarter and itâ€™s tough to measure we canâ€™t get at all that data specifically we do believe the stimulus checks et cetera were part of it and clearly a pent-up demand issue right from people not having shopped and then we have the -- something we talked about I think it was in last call you do have that revenge shopping aspect that I think comes out where people are passionate and want to get out there and we are entertaining. So pieces of that but you have the store closure thing we talked about which is going on all around us. So we believe that I would say a chunk of our has not been just the stimulus and the -- to the best of our knowledge we wouldnâ€™t be entering the second quarter with a similar trend which is why we specifically when we did the release we put that last bullet point there which is I guess is a little bit more specific than we normally would on how we start a quarter and why we wanted to say that we are entering it similarly. So you understand that the overall stimulus check thing isnâ€™t the only thing playing and it has to be some of those other issues in our business model store closures. By the way I do believe our business model now resonates more than it even did pre-COVID. I think consumers if ever they have even more so now with all the stress of whatâ€™s happened in the last year they appreciate the treasure hunt entertainment me time as I mentioned in the script â€œme timeâ€ they I think our model and the fact that we talked about earlier on the call weâ€™ve delivered a lot of exciting merchandise which plays right into this time period. I think thatâ€™s the vast majority of why weâ€™re getting the sales. And to point thatâ€™s why I think thereâ€™s sales upside as we look out.You know what I mean itâ€™s not just from the different stimulus government packages that have taken place where we wouldnâ€™t be seeing what seems to be a pretty consistent trend.So Jay to add one other thing in terms of market share gain as I look out here. Really through the balance of the year is one of the advantages we continue to have in this home business. We learned to even improve on it is the way we learn to some of the merchants a lot of merchants lunch or work virtually in a very effective manner. And our home division has a as I mentioned we have over 500 plus buyers in our home division that have collaborated just beyond even what we did before as well as we have satellite offices for not just home that are overseas that are now buying more merchandise for us than they did before. So when you -- I feel we can continue to actually now drive and even more eclectic mix of home which has the advantage that the consumer can buy it that day if itâ€™s a piece of furniture they can try it and buy it. I mean think about all the delivery issues that have taken place or so thatâ€™s all an added plus. So in addition to the apparel thing Scott was talking about as well as some other that are hot categories in the industry such as the beauty business. We have -- I give that team a lot of credit. Weâ€™ve really been doing a nice job. They collaborate strongly across division. And again some of the learnings that have taken place I think weâ€™re going to have a slight bit of advantage over what we did pre-COVID and the way weâ€™re able to flex and leverage all the different divisionâ€™s merchant knowledge. So I know long way but thatâ€™s a whole other piece that is making us feel even better about the future.Thank you.If you look John around the industry itâ€™s just the freight rates continue to escalate.Yeah. Okay. I believe that was our last call. I would like to thank you all for joining us today. Weâ€™ll be updating you again on our second quarter earnings call in August and from the team here at TJX we hope you all stay well and we wish you good health. Take care.,0.002542222,0.002842784,0.000164436
75,75,ADI,Lucarelli:,Thank you Ambrish. We will go to our last question please.I will answer backwards. I will start with kind of the sizing of data center for you. If you look at our comms business itâ€™s about 15% of total revenue. Thatâ€™s split about evenly between wireless and wireline about 50% 50% in each of those. And if you look at the wireline piece thatâ€™s where data center is embedded itâ€™s probably about 30% to 35% of that relates to the data center. What do we ship into this I know you outlined it pretty well. I am not going to go through it again. But I will pass it to Vincent and Prashant probably Vince to talk a little bit more about what the opportunity is in data center and why we are excited.Alright. Thank you Harlan. And thanks everyone for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript and all of our reconciliations will be available on our website. We hope you can join us at our in-person at Investor Day April 5. Thanks for joining the call and interest in Analog Devices. Have a good day.,0.003233075,0.003233075,0
76,76,ADP,Rodriguez,: There really isn't a simple answer to that to the first part. We'll come back to the -- I think the second question about the attach rates. Let me answer that one first. The attach rates are -- there's a couple of products where we have what I would call good attach rates acceptable which is saying as CEO speak for they could always be higher. Like our benefit admin tools our time and attendance systems. But most of our products and our worker's compensation tool in a down-market also has a high attach rate. But almost everything else that is quote unquote beyond payroll. So HCM in addition to kind of our core payroll solutions we're way under penetrated in terms of attach rates. So there is a lot of potential I think for that to improve as well. So on the first part of your question in terms of how we cross-sell as I started saying there isn't a simple answer because there isn't a simple answer. In some of our businesses we have very distinct organizations like in the down-market we have a large down-market sales force that works with accountants and other kind of third-party channels and also sell directly. And then we have a sales force that sells our retirement solutions are 401K products. And our insurance services solution those are distinct sales forces that basically share leaves with each other and they have incentives to do so. That down-market business also feeds business to our PEO through also incentives. But there is a separate and distinct sales force in the PEO as well. When you get into the up-market and into the mid-market you start to get some portion of our sales force which is able to sell multiple products or whatever call bundles. But even then you still have specialized sales forces in certain circumstances depending on I think the specialization or the complexity of the product. But in all cases we have primary sales. What I would call primary sales people. So the quarterback if you will on an account. Now I'm talking about upmarket and mid-market and those quarterbacks are really in charge of making sure that when it's appropriate and when a client has a need that we bring in our specialized sales people that have specific knowledge about some of our other HCM solutions. So I wish I could give you a simple answer but that's actually part of the secret sauce right? In terms of our ability to grow and outperform some of our competitors is to be able to do that well. And I'd like to say that I invented this but this is something that goes all the way back to the Frank Wattenberg days and to my predecessors . And this is a well - oiled machine in terms of our sales and distribution. And specifically you've just described about the cross-sell. And again to put a fine point on it roughly 50 percent of our bookings come from cross-sell and roughly 50 percent of our bookings come from new logos each year.: I wish I had a crystal ball in terms of answering where it's going to go. But I think just from a mathematical or technical standpoint the cost of sale is definitely pulling down because of this productivity increase. So this is the same leverage that you're seeing in so many industries and so many businesses including ours on the revenue happens on the bookings as well. When you get higher volumes it basically indicates higher -- unless you add a lot of expense by definition you get higher productivity. So you see us being reported in the press all the time about how worker productivity is up. Well hardly reason why worker productivity is up is because revenues of recovered volumes have recovered and it sustained people. Or you're adding a few more people now. Maybe people aren't focusing on is that worker productivity went down right as the pandemic kind of set in and people's revenues went down. So I hate to make it so simplistic mathematically. But some of that is what's happening now. So you do have to be careful about jumping to any medium to long-term conclusions because right now our cost of sale compared to last year and the year before is definitely coming down as a result of a very large increase in bookings with how a similar increase in expenses. We still though are not back to where our cost of sale was pre -pandemic. And we hope to get there. But that will require even a little bit more productivity during this year. But that would be our expectation is that whether it's the GDP or interest rates or employment that there's regression to the mean here as they very large economy. ADP's large Company but the economy is massive and it tends to regress to the mean on a lot of things and we also tend to regress to the mean s. So I think some of these things will work themselves out. And you have to just get past the base effects and the comparisons and so forth to really understand where you are and we won't know that until we're on the other side unfortunately I hate to say it.: Thanks for the question. The second part of your question I think kind of answers the first part. The answer is yes. Like I think part -- again hard to separate how much is just pure GDP growth new business formation etc. But the last part of your question there's no question that part of our growth is driven by what you are alluding to which is everyone now is looking for help in terms of hiring attracting people and frankly also trying to hold onto them. This is a great environment for us. The combination of strong GDP an administration that is more inclined towards regulation and then a tight labor market for people who do the things that we do. By that I mean payroll staff and HR staff at prospects and our clients. That's all a very good backdrop for us. I'm assuming that -- this is not going to resolve itself overnight in terms of the tightness in the labor market. We should anticipate some tailwinds here and some help for some period of time until that changes. And I hate to use the R word but some day at some point in the future doesn't see m anywhere near future given what's going on with government stimulus and government policy. But someday that might change. But we don't see that on the horizon right now. On the very first part of your question though in terms of the tight labor markets I would say the overwhelming impact of tight labor markets is positive on AEP. I mentioned one of the challenges we have which is tight labor market affects our own internal associates in terms of we have to hire service people and implementation people so it's harder for us like it is harder for anyone else. But that pale in comparison to the upside like a tight labor market drive new bookings as we just talked about in the last part of your question. But it also could create inflationary pressures which drives our balanced growth. It should drive interest rates higher which is one of the most underappreciated stories I think of ADP is the potential upside in our flow business. And the reason it's underestimated because it's done nothing for 10 years because they've been here for 10 years and has been nothing for pain and headwind. And just what I thought we were coming out of it we go into a pandemic and we get more pain and race go even lower than they were before. But I'm pretty sure that it those changes any lower now. Although I think we may have to file an AK after saying that. I'm making a statement on interest rates. But whatever. Hover around here go down a little bit there but it feels pretty certain that the long-term medium and long-term trend now for interest rates will be at least for gradual increases. And I'm not suggesting that there's still underlying demographics that may keep us from getting back to the same kind of 10-year rate that we had 15 years ago or ten years ago. But I think everyone knows when you look at real interest rates that there is upside on interest rate. So the tight labor market helps in a number of ways. It creates activity for our sales force. Every time there's activity and there's conversations we're going to win our fair share. So that's a great backdrop. It creates opportunities for our balances. I think it creates opportunities for the PEO because some of our billings are actually driven by as a percentage of wages. And whenever you have wage inflation if you are building on percent of wages to some extent that will help that's not So like an infinite thing because we won't just allow our revenue to go up indefinitely. We'd have to adjust those rates but in the medium-term we will see I think some tailwind from -- in the PEO from higher wages and wage growth which is inevitable outcome of a tight labor market.: On the first -- on the first part I'm not sure how much more color we can give you. We have a fair amount of detail in terms of losses and retention around we call non-controlled the losses which are broadly speaking out of business bankruptcies etc. And those have started to trend back up again. They're not back to normal levels but they started to trend back. I think that's not surprising because there's still a lot of liquidity and a lot of stimulus if you will even if it's not new stimulus. So when you have consumer spending doing what it's doing and you have activity doing what it's doing. It tends to be supportive of small business rather than the normal turnover that you have that's natural in the small business sector. I guess with hindsight like if 3 or 6 months ago when we were putting together our plan we'd had a crystal ball we would've probably -- and we had experienced with the pandemic we probably would have planned the downturn in retention to be slower. So we've been positively surprised by how long it's taking for those losses to regress back to normal. Having said that we don't know that they're going to regress 100 % backs because there's other parts of our retention that are controllable. We call controllable. In our controllable losses we see those going down as well. And I think Don made a common thing that should not be lost on you which is that our client satisfaction scores as measured by NPS are the highest they've ever been. And I give credit to the organization for during the pandemic being able to get through what was an incredibly difficult time for them personally in terms of they were trying to help our clients. But we also had a huge increase in volume because of all the government stimulus programs in the PPP loans etc. And this happened all over the world it wasn't just in the U.S.. And fortunately we maintained relative stability in our headcount. We didn't do mass layoffs and let a bunch of people go. So the combination of maintaining investment and also being able to to have people -- I don't know how to described it. Make a efforts to help our clients we were able to maintain those NPS where that actually haven't go up. And there's staying at very strong levels and we believe that there is a correlation between strong NPS and retention. So we may be able to see new record highs for retention on a permanent basis but it's way too early to make that prediction.: Sure. I think we talked about over the last couple of quarters as we kind of entered in the pandemic we obviously had a couple of particularly large clients that we're in industries that were particularly hard hit. So we've got put on a little bit off course if you will in terms of our implementations and our starts. We also I think started to focus on implementation tools. I think we had -- I don't know how many set -- how many we said we had sold. And as we started implementing in starting these clients. We recognize that we still have some work to do in terms of implementation tools and making sure that if and when we want to use third-party integrators to help us with that that we need to build out those tools. There has been quite a lot of focus on that effort. And we feel good about it. We actually -- I think we also talked about investments in the last quarter that we made to bring in some third-parties to help us with the evaluation. And in some cases the build of that to make sure that as we now enter a hopefully a period of time where we can really accelerate the implementations and the growth and the starts of those clients. But it's fair to say and I think we said in the last couple of quarters that our focused turn ed more to making sure that we have a strong foundation and that we had the right implementation tools to be able to get the business started that we intend to have in the next year or 2 which is hopefully quite -- quite a lot of business. And you'll hear more details about this when we get to our Investor Day on November 15th.: So on the first -- on the first question I think I said in my early comments that all of the HRO Solutions the Corporal Outsourcing Solutions are very very strong across-the-board right? Up-market because we have HRO Solutions in the up-market we have in the mid-market and we have them in the down-market. And in in the down market -- and in the mid-market we have PEO but we also have what you're alluding to which is a non-core employment. What I would call -- we call it comprehensive services as the name implies it provides a kind of broader assortment of services in addition to our traditional software in our traditional tax and other services. There is to my knowledge a lot of switching from clients that are what I would call typical clients of ADP that have payroll benefits and I'd then maybe TLM etc. whether it's in a down-market in the mid-market into these HRO Solutions there is not a lot to my knowledge of switching across because it typically. Again if we're doing our job from a sales standpoint you are really trying to find the right fit for the client. In some cases the client wants you to do their benefits admin and provide their benefits provide the workers comp and their 401-K. In other cases the client wants you to only do the administrative back-office of the payroll department in the HR department which would be the non - PEO solutions. So I think if we do our job well which I think we do in the sales process and in the upgrade process those clients tend to stay on those -- on whatever solution they have chosen. But to be clear both of them are growing at this point at rates that are multiples of our growth in employer services. And so it's quite impressive in terms of the tailwind and the growth rates that we have in all of the HRO businesses. On the last part of your question which I think was about positioning PEO in terms of market share and so forth. We have 600 and I think it's 630 000 roughly we reported worksite employees average worksite employees this last quarter. That's tripled what it was 10 years ago in the first quarter of fiscal year 11. And so and that's a higher market share than it was 10 years ago. So I don't know how else to answer that question other than to say that we have a proven track record of execution to continue to drive growth in the PEO that's faster than the markets. So I don't think there's any question about our positioning or our ability to drive market share as evidenced by our ability to execute.: So next-gen PEO equally excited as we are about next-gen HCM in terms of what this holds for the future for ADP. The challenge for us in terms of as we communicate and on November 15th we'll try to figure out a way to address this issue. Like we have 15 billion in revenue. So as well as next-gen HCM are going and next-gen payroll is going it just doesn't -- this is a future impact for ADP. so it's not in the next quarter. And I know you're not asking a question that's really about next quarter mark but I think it was a good opportunity to kind of throw that out there. That -- what's driving the performance of ADP this quarter this year and for the next 2 to 3 years is not going to be that from a financial standpoint. But in terms of positioning the Company for the future in terms of growth and creating competitive differentiation and the ability to drive new bookings they're absolutely critical. So I would say that on those measurements we're still happy and excited by the progress we're seeing with both next-gen HCM as well as next-gen payroll we have not gone to general availability so we're selling a lot of next-gen payroll but we're only selling in what we call the core of major accounts right now of the mid-market which is kind of 50 to 150 and this is no different in terms of the playbook that we use with our transition from our old platform to run in a down-market. And some of our more legacy platform in mid-market to then our next-gen Workforce Now version which we're on now. So we're doing the same thing with next-gen payroll and the same thing with next-gen HCM which is we're doing very carefully that we have a very large installed base. And we are not -- We're going to eventually move some of those clients and begin to move some of those clients. But we're happy with the business and the cash flow that we have and the clients satisfaction scores that are record levels on our existing platform. So we do not have any -- this is not panicking. There's no sense of crisis and there's no -- we have urgency but no crisis because I want to make sure people hear that. Like I don't want you to think that we all have a sense of urgency because the faster we get these two solutions to scale the faster we beat the competition.: It's a great question. I think the second part of question so hopefully you'll forget about first part because we don't have -- we try to prepare for everything and that one we'll have to follow-up with you on in terms of what regions or what states we're strongest in terms of our sales. I'm going to suspect that they were all strong because honestly like the PEO results were off the charts there can't be any state that wasn't in strong double-digit growth. But we'll follow up on that question. On the healthcare rate question you're right that we're not directly impacted but you're also right to imply that we're indirectly impacted because it does matter right? It matters to our clients what they're paying for healthcare. And I hate to be so simplistic but I think what the actual regression to the mean and large economies -- the healthcare world and insurance companies are also similar in terms of they regress right? So losses have an uncanny way of regressing to the mean. That's why I always caution people when all of a sudden someone thinks that they have this big decline in either workers comp costs or healthcare costs. It usually doesn't work that way. There's usually something that explains it and it usually regresses back to the mean. I think if I can try to answer -- what I think is the implication of your question there was a temporary decline in things like elective surgery and frankly healthcare in general. People even start to stop going to their primary care physicians and so forth that decreased healthcare costs temporarily. And I hate to use that word transitory that is now the favorite word it seems talk about inflation but it's very clear that that was transitory and that healthcare costs will come back. And so I think to the extent you had below normal renewals which would be our situation because we don't take risk on healthcare so we wouldn't see it in our margins and in our cost structure. But to the extent that we had below normal renewals we would expect those renewals to go back to normal because we would expect as healthcare costs go back to normal slowly that those costs would have to be pass-through. When you look at the healthcare insurance companies as much criticism as they get they are largely pass-through entities. They're paying hospitals and providers and other healthcare costs prescription drugs etc. And it's really not a business where you can say we can't pass this 10 percent increase in healthcare costs because their margins are even 10 percent. And so that business is very straightforward which is they try to earn a markup or margin for doing what they do in terms of managing networks etc. But in the end they have to pass those costs through. We have to also because we're a passive entity as well. And I think those who take risk on healthcare will probably see those costs go up over some period of time.: Same here.: There's not much more I can say as we really had terrific results. I want to thank Don for joining and I think you're all going to be very happy to meet him and get the benefit of his experience in ADP more broadly besides just in the finance organization. Because he has kind of real-world business experience within ADP as well. The -- I just want to end the way I usually end which is thanking our organization and particularly our front line associates because I'm not sure what's going on in other companies. but we would not be able to get our goals accomplished without people going above and beyond. I think we mentioned the tight labor market and that we're a little bit behind in terms of our hiring that means our people are working extra hard. An economist said that an increase in productivity I'd say that's just people working hard. And we really appreciate it our clients appreciate it. I think our shareholders appreciate it and I don't think a lot listen to this call but you should be aware of that whether it's here in other companies there's a lot of people out there that are pushing really hard to deliver. And many of us whether we're as consumers or buyers of products and businesses and so we're frustrated by what's happening in terms of supply chain and some of these other things. But all I see is a bunch of people working really really hard to try to fulfill the needs of our clients. And I think that's happening across the whole economy. And I think we'd show a little bit of patience with each other. Because this will all normalize as these variant now recedes I mean you're seeing already and some of the mobility data things will slowly get back to normal. People will come back into the labor force. And this great economy that we have will function the way it's supposed to function. But in the meantime I want to thank our associates for what they've done so far whether it's this last quarter and what they're going to have to do to get through this year-end which is going to be very challenging given the volumes we have and the capacity we have. So for that I thank them but I also thank all of you for listening and for being supporters of ADP. Thank you.,0.00364251,0.007654965,0.001318991
77,77,C,Mason:,Sure. Why donâ€™t I take that? So the first thing Iâ€™d say is that weâ€™re not at 10 right? So we ended the year last year 2021 at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure. So we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside of the last 3 months. Iâ€™d also point out that a number of things were important components of that. So if you look at Slide 6 youâ€™ll see that the loans and these are both ICG and consumer loans largely ICG largely corporate loans have come down by $600 million. And thatâ€™s really been a reduction in our risk exposure right? So borrowers paying down us limiting the extension of new credit etcetera. The AFS securities have come down $600 million. And that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales. So weâ€™ve gotten out of those securities. Yes there are some mark-to-market losses but they are not material. That flows through OCI not material. You can see that the off-balance sheet unfunded commitments have trended down as well. Deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because weâ€™ve actually seen the repayment of those loans come back and weâ€™ve been â€“ weâ€™ve had to put that cash with the Central Bank just given some of the restrictions that are there. Weâ€™ve been actively working down the reverse repo assets which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure. And weâ€™ve been bringing down the third-party cross-border exposure. So a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to 7.8%. And if you think about the $1 billion that I referenced is kind of a net of $6.8 billion right? So the second part of your question was how do we think about reserves and what are those different components. Well we look at the reserves in terms of the actual name-specific loan exposure we have how weâ€™re rating those entities in this environment. And then we actually run that through our models and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating. So that $1 billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these Russian clients and entities the broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of Russia due to things like commodity pricing and what have you. And then there is a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this. So we built the reserves considering those multiple components. The last point Iâ€™d make is that when you look at some of the names there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country and they provide parental support for some of the exposure thatâ€™s here as well. So we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well.Hi. Good morning.Itâ€™s an increase in our risk-weighted assets thatâ€™s really tied largely to the derivative exposures that we have. What I would say is obviously how one manages their exposures and balance sheet and engagement with clients will impact that. But importantly itâ€™s a market dynamic that needs to play out as well. So as more RWA and capital is required for these types of positions there has to â€“ itâ€™s going to impact returns and it ultimately will impact pricing as the market starts to incorporate this now higher requirement. And so it will continue to evolve. The thing I would point you to is that as we think about managing our businesses and in particular markets. You would have heard us mention at Investor Day that we are looking â€“ continually looking for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet optimize RWA right. And so we talked about targeting a revenue to RWA for our markets business and we are actively working at that now. And thatâ€™s going to be important as we continue to manage not only the balance sheet requirements that we have but our intent to try and return more capital to shareholders and improve our returns.Good morning.Sure. So look I mean there â€“ what we have built in â€“ what we have got built into the forecast and the walk back to 12% is the forward curve as of the end of the quarter. So thatâ€™s what we have built in. As we think about that that was a pretty sudden move through the quarter of 160 basis points on the 2-year in the quarter. Thatâ€™s now in the expectation. We have built in an assumption around more rate moves that could happen just as a bit of cushion as I think about the outlook and as I think about the walk. We do have hedges in place as it relates to some of the positions that we have and as it relates to OCI and we will continue to manage that to ensure we reduce the risk from rate increases which by the way we have been actively doing over the past couple of years. If you look at kind of how the balance sheet has evolved we have been moving from out of AFS and into held to maturity over the past couple of years reducing that risk of a negative impact to OCI. And if you look at the DVO 1 we have cut that down from as high as $60 million to about $30 million or so. So we have been actively managing with an eye towards how do we reduce that sensitivity if you will. Why donâ€™t I let Jane kind of touch on the Mexico piece.Yes. So look I mean as you said Jane whatâ€™s going to be important is that we make the right decision for the people for the business and equally important for our shareholders and we are going to absolutely make sure we do that. In terms of the way this plays out is I think you are aware and I have mentioned before that we have got roughly $2.8 billion $2.9 billion currency translation adjustment related to our consumer Mexico franchise. And so when we sign the deal we will have that flow through the P&L ultimately gets offset at closing. And so again you would have another timing difference between the accounting impact and the ultimate economic impact but thatâ€™s kind of the component that would play through it signing whenever that were to occur.Good morning.Yes. I donâ€™t have that breakout Betsy. I mean I â€“ we will have to kind of get back to you. I donâ€™t have that breakout.So look in the first quarter the major driver that we have seen is really on the credit risk side from an RWA point of view and that was really tied to SACR. Thatâ€™s the biggest driver of the fourth quarter the first quarter RWA increase that we have seen. So the RWA from a market risk point of view was mostly flat due to reductions in trading book securitizations that was kind of â€“ those are the kind of the main drivers there.Yes. So like I said securitizations would be an offset as would some of the equity derivatives.Yes. Look on the â€“ let me kind of take that. So on the revenue side as you would have heard us describe there have been puts and takes that have played through the quarter and there is still a fair amount of uncertainty thatâ€™s out there. And so while there have been increases as it relates to rates and we have seen and expect to see some benefit play through for that there has also been an impact on banking revenues as we see the uncertainty creating a dynamic where corporate clients are pausing particularly as it relates to equity capital markets and debt capital markets. And so as I mentioned there are offsets that play out. And so we felt comfortable kind of maintaining the guidance on the revenue top line. In terms of the expenses as I mentioned at Investor Day the spend that we have going on in expenses is critically important. And we are still growing them as it relates to transformation and as it relates to business-led investments. On the business-led investment side the good news is that we are starting to see some of the top line strength play out not just driven by rates but also driven by things like fees which is what we forecasted. On the transformation side we continue to make progress. And we have talked about how critically important that is to our operations going forward. We expect that that will peak or arc if you will as we talked about at Investor Day and that will occur in the near-term and will be an important offset if you will to the structural expense base that we have as the efficiencies from those spending â€“ from that spending excuse me plays through.Yes sure. Look I am not giving kind of guidance kind of broken out if you will for the revenues. We are standing by the full year guidance that we have talked about. Obviously with rates moving the way that they have we would expect that we would see some improvement on the NII line but I havenâ€™t given specific guidance broken out for the two lines. In terms of the deposit base we have as you know we have got a mix of consumer and corporate client deposits. We skew a bit more heavily towards the corporate client deposit base. That comes with â€“ generally comes with a higher beta. And so they are likely to be more reactive to and reactive sooner to the increase in interest rates. And quantitative tightening will certainly have a longer term impact on the level of deposits thatâ€™s out there. But with that said our plans both in the near-term and as we have played out the Investor Day forecast donâ€™t hinge upon significant growth in deposits. We would expect some growth but growth consistent with kind of pre-pandemic levels but thatâ€™s not outsized growth and we believe our strategy which is broader than just going after deposits but really is around solutions for corporate clients and the full spectrum of financial services for the consumers that we focus on will allow for us to capture an appropriate level consistent with how the economy evolves.Thanks Erika.Yes. And the only thing I would add is a couple of numbers right. So the sales are up 24% year-over-year exceeding pre-pandemic levels across the categories. Acquisitions are up 23% year-over-year. Again bringing on new card customers into our family if you will. Revenues are down 2% but you really have to look through the investments that we are making in acquisitions and the rewards costs associated with those that impact that revenue being down 2%. If you adjust for the acquisition costs actually our revenues would be up 1% year-over-year. So I agree completely with you Jane which is we are very pleased with the progress here. We are seeing similar momentum start to play through on the retail services side as well. The sequential performance on average interest earning balances is a good signal for how things will play out. And we continue to feel good about the growth we forecasted towards the back half of the year.Sure. And good morning and I would like to separate kind of NII guidance from the IRE sensitivity and disclosure that we have. And so you are absolutely right and I am not moving â€“ we are not moving off of our IRE disclosure at all. The analysis is such that with a parallel shift in rates of about 100 basis points that we see somewhere around $2.5 billion to $3 billion of an increase kind of play through. And as you know as I have said before thatâ€™s cross currencies with about two-thirds of that being to non-U.S. currencies and the other third obviously being U.S. So that is still our view from an ROE point of view. We are not â€“ we havenâ€™t changed that view.Yes. So why donâ€™t I take that and kind of try and talk through it. So the first thing I would say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance. I just want to be clear that at Investor Day thatâ€™s what we talked about. We would love for the number to be different but we understand and we know that this is whatâ€™s required to get the franchise to where it needs to be. And so we are taking those hard decisions. We are spending the money where we need to spend it. We are being diligent about that to make sure that we are not being wasteful in that effort. But we donâ€™t want to create or go through the things that we have gone through in the past in the way of under-investing. And so we are going to avoid that. The second thing is and you acknowledge that kind of in your reference to transformation and business-led investments. On the structural investments spend I should say about half of that is from inflation so not the full 4%. A portion of it is also from non-consent order risk and control spend that we are making things like the financial crime unit things like cyber spend things like the work we are doing around our wholesale credit operations important things. And there are some productivity savings that play through that. And then the final piece on the volume related is their transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do on the trading side their spend that we make in order to drive that activity. And the mix matters. And so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter the mix of the marketâ€™s activity impacts the level of volume-related expenses thatâ€™s generated through those transactions. So those are a couple of things. Again we are consistent with guidance. We believe we are on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of mid-single digits. And we are looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time.,0.00274986,0.003204048,0.000190792
78,78,MMC,Glaser:,"Thanks. So you can see Meyer we're all over the ESG space and expect it to underpin our growth in future years. Next question please.Yeah. It absolutely is David. Ultimately the way we run our business is -- one of the operative words that we use is more. We want to get better every year. We want to provide our clients with more capabilities with less internal costs. And so our search for efficiency is a core part of this executive team's job and something that we're very focused on. And whether it's real estate more purposeful travel and tech modernization operational efficiency gains the fact that we've got several new faces around the table and new faces come up with good ideas and fresh ideas. And there's lots of ways of running the business. And our goal over time is supporting our clients with a combination of really good comp and ben because that makes us a strong company and helps us be an employer of choice in the industries that we operate. But always relentlessly going after all other expenses that have just fundamental aspects of running a multinational. So this is a midterm and a long-term downward trend in our expense base in all other expenses. Next question -- or you have a follow-up David?Yeah. I mean I think the way to look at it is our revenue over the next several years should benefit from the organic hiring that we did last year. I mean you look at it on the basis of -- last year we had an opportunity to make significant organic investments in building our business. And it's something that we always focus on delivering good results today but always focusing on the future and how we can build a better company. And this is an opportunity that John and I haven't seen in our careers in terms of being able to build the business on an organic basis. And so we had the opportunity and we had the means and last year's strong levels of organic growth helped provide those means and meant that we could still deliver good results to investors last year while we were making these strong organic investments. You have to know that we all know around the table that organic investments are always short-term dilutive and it's harder to do in some ways and acquisitions just by the P&L map but we made the right decision and press forward. The vast majority of that expense is comp and ben. And the way I would look at it is we've got another two or three quarters and then the expense growth is going to be in the rearview mirror but the capability and the growth kicker will remain. And so this is a huge benefit to the overall organization. We're not going to quantify whether Henry and Sally are delivering today. I mean we're a big organization. We've added to our market leading capabilities. We like where we are positioned right now in terms of the performance of some of that strategic hiring and this is going to be a best with for us in coming years as well as this year.Sure. Next question please.Sure. I'll start and then I'll hand to John. M&A is a big part of our organization and not just for the last decade but literally since its inception. We don't have a budget around acquisitions. We're cautious when we make acquisitions. We like to cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. As has been commented in the marketplace before many times over the last decade multiples have risen. So therefore we're even more selective than we used to be and we're careful around pro formas because most of the companies that we acquire are private. And we want to really understand the ongoing characteristics of the business and not some fancy dressed up pro forma statement. And so the one thing that we're committed to is capital deployment. And so we look at -- we favor share repurchase -- we favor acquisitions over share repurchase but we certainly favor share repurchase over building more cash on the balance sheet. And so we will utilize that circa $4 billion between the dividend which is 7% and growing acquisitions and then share repurchase. But the M&A pipeline ebbs and flows it looks pretty good right now. But we don't really have -- we wouldn't at this stage to have a strong idea of where we would end up the year on that because many of the discussions we have are exclusive and the discussion is essentially the company decided whether they want to join forces with us or stay private. But John do you want to talk about the pipeline or how we're looking at M&A these days?Sure. John?Are you sneaking in two questions?Thanks. Martine?Perfect. Next question. Thanks.Sure. I mean I think we -- I used the resilience before it's not just us. I think the world has gotten pretty resilient in that. We're not in 2020 anymore and we've been able to adapt to different ways that have occurred in certain segments whether that's in Europe U.S. Asia I mean the one thing about COVID is no part of the world actually escaped. And so we don't see a tremendous impact on our results from COVID. It would be more of a softer potential impact on just any headwind on GDP or business development. But other than that we feel pretty good. I mean you just look at Marsh's results as an example in Asia-PAC in the quarter it wasn't -- it's not COVID free. It was pretty active in Asia-PAC. So in some ways in terms of impact on our results we think COVID is pretty much in the rearview mirror as well knock wood.Thanks.So thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter and a particular shout out to all of our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients. So thank you very much.""",0.008891682,0.020522118,0.008225122
79,79,CVS,Guertin:,Yes. Steven weâ€™ve seen that volume come up a little bit. And for the most part that business has tracked with our expectations this year but I certainly wouldnâ€™t characterize it as an inflection point or anything like that. Itâ€™s definitely been recovering from its bottom during COVID and has more or less been consistent with expectations this year.Yes. Itâ€™s â€“ obviously we had a very strong quarter. There are some dynamics in the quarter year-over-year that have to do with sort of the vaccine program starting last year and we had very high expense levels last year in the vaccine business and thatâ€™s obviously been fine-tuned now. So year-over-year despite the fact that vaccine volumes were down which I think is a little bit of the gross margin question answer. We actually did better kind of bottom line wise because of sort of the G&A components and some of the reimbursement has changed over that period of time too. Testing again thatâ€™s probably been down sort of year-over-year. But overall we probably had a contribution towards growth of a couple of hundred million from COVID in Q1. The other dynamics I think we are â€“ we had a light kind of cold and flu season right. So there was that going on both in the front store and the back of the store. But again script growth was good there was nothing particularly surprising on the reimbursement side. The front store was good across sort of a broader set of categories than just OTC. In fairness last yearâ€™s first quarter â€˜21 was still probably somewhat depressed because of what was going on. But overall the metrics looked good.Yes. And itâ€™s been an interesting dynamic right? When we set out on this journey some of these companies were valued at 7x to 8x revenue right. And now they have â€“ and that probably wasnâ€™t right right. But now some of them have regressed to maybe one or two and that may not be completely correct either. So I mean the answer is the longer this persists right. The greater this becomes sort of the reality upon which people make some decisions. And so I would say sort of directionally yes. But it still remains challenging given sort of the memories of where some of these values were.Yes. So the â€“ let me just sort of talk a little bit about what our COVID expectations are. And the answer to your question eventually will be thatâ€™s probably in the neighborhood albeit we have gotten there with a little bit different path now with the fourth booster. We expect now about 18 million vaccines for 2022 including the provision for the fourth booster for the defined populations. This would be a decline of about 70% versus 2022. Testing excluding OTC is expected to be down 50% plus or minus. And the OTC test will be in the same neighborhood maybe a little bit higher. But overall thatâ€™s going to probably produce a contribution year-over-year. Thatâ€™s down 60% 65% on COVID. And if you do the math you are not going to be far off your number. A lot of that contribution maybe half-ish is in the first quarter of this year and it is more back end loaded than back end loaded going forward. And again to some extent the juryâ€™s out in an endemic situation in terms of where we will go with additional boosters testing and test to treat and things like that. So there is more to play out as in terms of how that ripples out in the second half of this year but into next year. For HCB the picture is more nuanced in the sense that we are now 3 years removed from our 2019 base line. But maybe most importantly we have now been able to reflect the COVID expenses in product pricing. And so as I mentioned in my remarks overall cost trends came in consistent or slightly better versus our trended baseline which while I am not going to declare victory prematurely thatâ€™s a very encouraging result both for â€˜22 and potentially â€˜23 as well. I think what this means for â€˜23 though is I think we have to return to how we have traditionally looked at this business which is by matching price increases with expected cost trends and managing revenue growth and operating margin levels.I think that probably assumes some leverage ratio thatâ€™s a little bit higher than where we are today but still consistent with sort of our investment-grade rating strategy. But I think that ballpark is in the neighborhood.Yes. Proceed with your question.Yes. So what I would say A.J. on this is we certainly remain committed to delivering the EPS target for 2024. And what we described at the Investor Day was a pathway to sort of get there with an M&A contribution. And I certainly wouldnâ€™t step away from that yet. But it was a pathway and inevitably pieces of that pathway might be different. And I am not sort of abdicating the number that we wonâ€™t get the earnings contribution but I do want to go back to the capital point that if we were hypothetically in that position capital continues to be a lever that we can use. You recall at Investor Day when you just looked at the pure capital if we did just sort of deploy all that capital you can get on top of these numbers. So itâ€™s â€“ this is about longer term strategic positioning that we are doing. And again I think itâ€™s important that we do the right deal for us and for the strategy. And I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that we can satisfy both commitments. But I also want to make sure we do the right deal because itâ€™s that important for our future.Yes. And I would say in the quarter mainly I think because we made wage moves last year I donâ€™t think we felt a lot of pinch but the one obviously the one place that we did see it is actually a result of the kind of cousin of inflation and thatâ€™s interest rates and some of the losses that â€“ realized capital losses that we took in the portfolio related to that. And that will be something to keep in mind going forward. We have a $20 billion plus fixed income portfolio that has moved from about $1 billion gain position unrealized gain position at the end of the year to approximately $1 billion unrealized loss position. And there is always some element of portfolio turnover and management during the year. So thatâ€™s something that I think will continue to monitor closely. As you mentioned I mean as we think forward there is a potential across all of our businesses for both the labor and G&A aspects but I think as I have thought about this itâ€™s the cost of goods sold aspect that I have â€“ we have certainly thought about a lot. I would remind everyone that historically higher inflation has also driven a higher top line particular in the HCB in the PSS businesses. From a COGS standpoint I wouldnâ€™t say we are seeing it show up in pharmacy yet â€˜22 I think we are in very good shape as most of our contracts are all locked down in HCB. Our average HCB contract is about 3 years in duration. And so obviously some number of those will be coming up for â€˜23. But I will also point our one of my earlier comments that we still have a lot of pricing leverage on 2023 and will certainly fully reflect our thinking on inflation as we think about forward pricing. On retail obviously we will be watching that as well but it is a dynamic that can actually help frankly with our membership programs and also make our store brands more attractive relative to other products. So there are certainly a lot of fingers of this but I do think we are looking at this kind of thoroughly and thinking about all the levers we can pull to mitigate the impact.On PSS to your point I think when you looked at our first quarter results and this is something we anticipated but we did have a very successful growth season and a very successful welcome season. And we did staff to sort of create that positive experience for our new customers. So expense levels are certainly a little bit higher in Q1 than sort of the run rate for the rest of the year. There is some movement but the rest of the year the quarters are generalized sort of in the same neighborhood as each other for the rest of the year. Alan mentioned before from a 340B standpoint we are largely assuming a flat year-over-year contribution. So a lot of the increases are coming sort of from the core elements of the business kind of around growth and specialty and things like that.Yes. I mean it certainly emanates in some ways right from the strength of our ongoing ability to generate sort of deployable capital. And I want to make sure people understand that. Itâ€™s less that itâ€™s something that we are going to rush out to do than it is to fully understand the strength of that capital and the fact that that remains a lever that we can pull over time and in some ways has the potential to be a safety net from year-to-year given just the normal fluctuations of the business.,0.003120112,0.004480004,0.000696615
80,80,AMT,Smith:,Yes sure. Thanks for joining us. So I'll just remind you in terms of the long-term guidance that we have out there it was over a 7-year average really going out to 2027 and we were looking at at least 4% growth over that time on average reported and on a normalized basis excluding the impact -- the negative impact of the profit would be up 5%. You know what that metric looked like in '21 and now you see kind of where we're guiding in '22. We'll hit an average of about 2% for those two years on a reported basis. And if you exclude again normalized for the Sprint churn that would be up around 5%. And we're actually seeing that in Q1 in terms of our U.S. organic growth which came in at about 0.6% for the quarter. And that did have an impact from Sprint churn that was pretty close to 4%. So that would have been up in the mid- to upper 4s if you normalize through the Sprint churn. So that's certainly where we expect to hit. If you look at the '23 to '27-time period we would look at reported organic tenant billings growth being greater than 5% greater than or equal to 5%. And on a normalized basis around 6% greater than or equal to 6%. So we do see that acceleration kind of in momentum. We think we're in for a nice run here a really stable long-term healthy growth in the U.S. business once we work through the Sprint churn. And in these numbers it's important to point out that two-thirds of the -- not just the underlying revenue but also the growth is already contracted in the MLAs that we have the holistic MLAs. And it does include the acceleration and the partnership we have with DISH in terms of that agreement where revenue begins this year. It accelerates through the year and then it will be there over the long-term. So hopefully that gives you a little color Michael in terms of the U.S. growth rates.Yes. Thanks Alex. Thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us. So we're working through the financing plan. We're very excited at the prospects and the different opportunities we have. As I said in our prepared remarks we're looking at equity and equity component. That's really the final piece of the entire CoreSite financing. We ended the quarter here at about 4.6 times leverage. Our target range is between 3 and 5 times. And we do have a plan to delever over the next couple of years. So we expect by the end of the year to get into the mid- to upper 5 times. So that's where the equity component comes in. We're looking at raising about $5 billion from an equity transaction. That's what's in our base model. And the outlook just to reiterate here the base plan assumes that we're going to do a common equity issuance for the $5 billion at roughly $235 a share. That's what's in our 2022 guidance for AFFO and AFFO per share growth. But with that said we're also looking at other forms of equity. So complementing the common equity with some preferred convertible equity instruments other kinds of convertible instruments and private capital. So we are looking at private capital options. Much of that has come from inbound inquiries that we've had. When people heard that we were buying CoreSite I think there was a lot of excitement in the marketplace in terms of the high-quality nature of those assets. So there was a lot of inbound interest there. We also went out with some outbound inquiries and we've been working through a process. So -- the other thing I would just clarify here Alex I think I mixed up the numbers on the leverage. We're ending at 6.4 and I think I may have said 4.6. So again we're getting back down into the mid- to upper 5s by the end of the year. I think you made a comment in your question that we might be pushing the equity financing into Q3. I'm not sure that's correct but we're working through the process. There's a good chance that we could have it wrapped up in Q2 like we initially said at the outset of the year.Yes Ric. So -- Oi has kind of finished their process of exiting the market and splitting their business up into the other three remaining carriers. So we do see that as a positive event taking that -- those leases and putting them with carriers that are financially secure and kind of in a healthy competition in that market. So we think that is certainly going to be productive. We do have a chunk of revenue from Oi. We have about 6.7 -- just about seven years remaining on average on those leases. Ric in terms of the the revenue impact to our business it's less than 1% of our revenues globally that we have with Oi down in Brazil. Even though we have that nearly seven years on average that's an average so there could be some leases that come up a little bit earlier than that. And we may see churn beginning as early as next year and kind of moving through the next few years. So we'll be working through that process. But in general we think it's a healthy thing for the industry there in Brazil. We've been working through kind of the process as Oi has for the last couple of years. So I think it's good to get that behind us and get it behind the wireless segment there in Brazil so everyone can move forward.Sure Jonathan. I can give you that. It's really just a variety of small acquisitions on the tower side. Many of them were in Europe. We do have an arrangement with a carrier in Europe where we consistently buy a number of sites throughout the -- throughout each quarter in Europe. We're also buying a few down in in Latin America 1s and 2s here and there. We also always have a pipeline in the U.S. where we're rolling up a few acquisitions here and there. And then there's some payments that are related to the prior year deals that we acquired. So there's really not a ton going on. We think about it in terms of Europe and in Latin America primarily.No Jon we're not expecting anything material from that perspective. We don't see it -- we don't see any real negatives. Nothing meaningful to note. So we're committed and kind of confident in the growth rates that I outlined a little earlier in the call.And Batya I'll give you a couple of specific numbers here. On the costs -- you mentioned the cost of the builds. They're coming in at a little less than 100 000 on average maybe closer to 75 000 on average per site. And we are continuing to see the targeted NOI yields being in the low to mid-teens. So we're in the range of about 14% now which is great. Regarding to your question on DISH we are seeing activity from DISH in the U.S. we did last year as you know and that continues this year. We see it mostly showing up in our financials through our services business. So we're continuing to have strong volume and activity in our services business. We're projecting in and around $225 million to $230 million in services revenue for this year. Last year it was up to about $250 million. So there's a slight pullback there. But if you think about our services activity for the first quarter of 2022 it's almost 100% growth over that same time period in last year. And certainly the DISH greenfield build is a big part of that. And if you rewind back to 2020 our services business was driving less than $100 million in revenue. So we've seen that step up in our services which really highlights the level of activity that we're seeing in the U.S. And again DISH is part of that. We'll begin to see leasing revenue here this year from DISH and that will ramp in the back half of the year. And we'll exit at of course a much high level of leasing revenue from DISH than we entered the year. And then that will ramp and continue for years to come.Yes. Thanks Phil. Thanks for joining the call and thanks for the question. So in terms of the capital raise I mean I don't want to get into too much hypothetical there. A lot of different deals over in Europe a lot of different stuff. I don't want to guess in terms of the level of capital that potentially could be needed. I would tell you our equities are really strong. We've got a lot of support in the equity markets. If we wanted to go out and raise equity we're very confident that we can do that for the right value accretive deal for our shareholders. So that's what I would say in terms of the potential for any other acquisitions and in issuing equity. Certainly we'll continue to be active and looking around. We like the transaction that we have in Europe. We like what we're seeing in the Telxius business. We think that was a high-quality set of assets with really good contracts and we purchased it at the right time. So from a European perspective we like exactly where we sit today and we are focused on financing the CoreSite opportunity as well. Jumping over to the deceleration from Q1 to Q2 in our OTBG contributions from colocations and amendments it's dropping down from like the mid-30s for Q1 into the low 30s for Q2. It's not Verizon-driven it's really just mechanics of the MLAs and where some use right fees kick in early in the year. And then we do see that ramping up and we expect it to be in the range of 40 plus each of the final two quarters in the year. So that's kind of the way to think about that ramp. There's nothing concerning about the step down in Q2. It's all just MLA mechanics and we feel very good about the level of activity in the position of our U.S. portfolio.Thanks everyone for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to me or the IR team with any further questions. Thanks again.,0.003174245,0.003951132,0.000445474
81,81,VRTX,Kewalramani:,Yes. Mike with regard to enrollment it is really simply too early to comment on enrollment dynamics for VX-147. We presented and shared the Phase II data just in December and the Phase III started just 3 months after that in March. So a little too early to call. But as I commented I think the genotyping study the number of trial sites that we are opening around the globe and the fact that this is a study where both arms get treatment will help with enrollment. On the GFR question in the Phase III portion the -- this group of patients those with 2 APOL1 alleles have a very rapid decline. And when I say that I mean north of 5 ccs per year. And when you have that kind of rapid decline it gives you the opportunity to assess the impact of your drug which is why this 1-year accelerated endpoint potential is really important. So what we demonstrated in Phase II is reduction in proteinuria. That was the approximately 50% reduction 47.6% on -- that is very tightly correlated with the EGFR the measure of kidney function and the measure of kidney function in people with 2 APOL1 alleles regardless of whether you call it FSGS or you call it another disease is very high. So I feel very good about where we are in terms of getting the clinical trial up and running and very good about the way we've designed the endpoint on both proteinuria and eGFR.Let me ask Charlie to start with your question on the inventory for the quarter. Charlie do you want to talk a little bit about the revenues for the quarter and how you see inventory?And with regard to your questions on VX-880 Phil what we shared earlier this week is what we know. By regulation the agency is 30 days to provide us their list of questions or their information request. We are highly confident in this program and deeply committed to type 1 diabetes. And we're looking forward to constructively and expeditiously working with the agency to resume the trial in the U.S. as soon as possible. The trial is up and running as you rightfully point out in 2 regions right now in the U.S. and in Canada. The trial remains up and running in Canada. We have not received any word from Health Canada for any questions or concerns that they have. And with regard to opening up additional sites that's always been in the plan. It has nothing to do with the hold in the U.S. and we intend to have more sites coming on in time.Yes. Colin I'll start and then I'm going to ask David to add a little comment. Colin I won't speak directly to any competitor. That's not my practice. But let's talk about CF in general. Over the years we've established a leadership position in CF and we've not only sustained it but we've expanded it. And our goal of out innovating ourselves and if possible even bringing more efficacious medicines forward than TRIKAFTA. And absolutely in the case of the last 5 000 patients bringing forward a nucleic acid therapy for them that remains unchanged. TRIKAFTA is the standard of care today. And the closest competitor to TRIKAFTA has been and remains today our own VX-121561 tezacaftor. I'm going to ask David to just give you a few comments on why we have so much confidence in our molecules and the HBE assays which are really the workhorse and the translational element of what we do. David a few comments from you on our confidence and why we know when we have something in the lab it translates into the clinic.Yes. Well it's really good questions. I'm going to reframe the question a little bit and ask Bastiano to comment but I want to make sure I explain this well. The way you know that a patient is insulin independence actually is by a very strict criteria. And that strict criteria is they don't take insulin any longer exogenous insulin. Their fasting glucose level is less than 126 and their postprandial that's to say after food glucose level is less than 180. And the reason we're able to declare patient number one as insulin independent is because they meet all of those criteria. Now you asked a good question about what do we expect in terms of durability of effect. And I'm going to turn it over to Bastiano to talk about the experience with cadaveric transplants the quantity and quality of our cells and why we think that our approach is a durable long-term durable approach. Bastiano?I think that was a .Operator we have time for one more question.Yes. Sure thing. Liisa we shared a fair amount of data on all 3 patients dosed to date the first 2 patients at half dose and the first full dose patient who is at the day 30 milestone across all of the patients in terms of efficacy we see really good efficacy. And we've shared now out to day 270 on patient number one who is insulin independent. You're right we haven't shared all of the details at all of the time points across the patients. but you should expect us to share all of the details in terms of hemoglobin A1c C-peptide levels stimulated and fasting as well as the CGM that's the continuous glucose monitoring data and of course all safety at upcoming congresses this year. So you will see all of the data on the patients with all of the follow-up.Yes. On CTX001 we shared last data on I believe 22 patients last year at the European Hematology meeting. We now have dosed over 75 patients. So we have substantially more information and you should expect to see that at upcoming congresses this year. With regard to the data package for the agency what we need to do as we've discussed is complete our discussions with them. And the 2 outstanding areas of discussion are the number of patients and the duration of follow-up that they would like to see in the filing. You know we have all of the designations like RMAT and orphan and such. So we've had the opportunity to have conversations that bring us to this point. It's now wrapping up those conversations with both the U.S. and the EU to wrap up on the discussion of numbers and duration.Yes. Liisa I think you're asking about in the U.S. and EU how do we see bed capacity for patients to be able to come in and have the procedure for CTX001. Since we're out of time I'll just take it really quickly. Stuart and the team have mapped this out. It is very concentrated the overall helming majority of patients in the EU who qualify for this therapy are concentrated in 4 countries. The overwhelming majority of patients in the U.S. who qualify for this therapy are concentrated in less than 25 states and we have mapped out the centers where they would be treated. And yes we see that the numbers of patients that we expect to be treated are going to have a way to have that done in centers with the right expertise.,0.002748162,0.002813399,8.15E-05
82,82,UBER,Khosrowshahi:,Yes absolutely. As far as gaining share versus our competition I'll tell you gaining share isn't a priority for us right now. It's happening naturally in some of the reopenings and it could be because of a mixed shift for example travel the travel category is growing at very very significant rates and we tend to skew high on the travel category or the Uber for business category. So we are observing some share gain in the U.S. and frankly in most countries around the world we're observing these kinds of share gains. And it maybe that the kind of consumer that's an Uber consumer is higher end travels a lot travels for business et cetera is coming to the platform pretty quickly and obviously we're a beneficiary of that. Our focus is on profitable growth and I think we're able to achieve profitable call it durable growth while gaining share versus our competitors because of the power of the platform. And so it's kind of naturally happening. It's not something that we have to lean into and we're a lot less focused on let's say our competitors or competitors share as we are the opportunity to grow the business durably to add on new segments such as taxi or hail-ables two-wheelers three-wheelers or lower cost product whether it's high capacity vehicles et cetera that's really the focus and the share will take care of itself although it has been taken care of itself. And we're quite constructive in terms of share gains. As far as the delivery reopening impact and frequency listen when you look at our delivery business MAPCs were up 4% year-on-year basket sizes were up 3% year-on-year frequency was up 4% year-on-year. So all of the core metrics that drive the business are positive and because of our innovation as it relates to bringing more earners on to the platform and then the density of the network driving cost for transaction down we're able to improve the margins of the delivery business. So we're happy with the trends that we see and we think that our frequency is going to also be assisted by our cross-platform usage and a higher penetration of Uber One members into our gross booking space. We are the penetration of Uber One members is still low generally for us and low compared to some of our competitors. And we see higher frequency with Uber One members. So we think that's a natural tailwind that can maybe combat some of the headwinds that some folks are seeing in the reopening.Well by the way one note I didn't answer and I want to answer all questions. I didn't answer the question on taxi margins. So as it relates to taxi margins first of all margins differ by geography. So for example in the U.S. the deals that we've done with the taxi companies should be at quite attractive margins that are consistent with the rest of our business. In some markets let's say in Japan or some developing markets our taxi margins are lower but we've consistently seen â€“ we're able to start at lower margins and then increase margins over a period of time. So when we think about the growth of our mobility business and the 10% incremental EBITDA margins that we are looking to deliver our core products let's say Uber Eats X or Reserve or Black those will tend to deliver higher than 10% incremental margins. We'll use some of those the incremental above 10% to invest in products such as taxi three-wheelers two-wheelers et cetera in order to drive what I would call durable growth MAPC growth et cetera. And we're constantly balancing the two and hopefully you've seen as it relates to our execution over the past couple quarters and years that we have our hands on all the different levers in order to deliver very very healthy topline growth and the kind of profitability that investors are especially looking for nowadays. All right. Next question?Hi James and thanks for the question. The most important factor that is helping these conversations move forward is that drivers want to be independent contractors. Drivers prize flexibility above anything. That's the reason why they earn on our platform. I think everybody knows in the U.S. if you want a job you can have a job. If you want a full-time job it's not a problem getting a job but our opportunity flexible work opportunities and healthy work opportunities is unique. You can work for us you can work for competitors you can work when you want you can work where you want et cetera. It's pretty powerful. And I think that fortunately or unfortunately in our Zoom world where white collar workers now have a lot more flexibility maybe they also appreciate the value of flexibility in a way that they couldn't appreciate previously. So as it relates to New York or any other state the good news is regulators are more and more aware that of what drivers want and drivers overwhelmingly want flexibility and they want other protections and benefits whether it's minimum earnings or other benefits which may change state to state to state. So I don't want to comment on New York specifically we're having promising discussions there but you never know when kind of the regulatory wins move one way or the other. But generally I would say that the regulatory momentum is positive. You see that in Washington in Massachusetts we have a ballot initiative out there. We are very confident of our prospects in Massachusetts. And essentially we like to see a negotiated settlement in these cities. Certainly we'll look to have a negotiated settlement in Massachusetts but we're confident if we have to go to the ballot and hopefully New York will get there but we can't predict the time.Welcome.All right. Last question.And on delivery side?All right. Thank you everyone for joining us on the call and great work to the Uber team. Q1 was a super super strong quarter. We're expecting more of that in Q2. I think this is a quarter where we're starting to show separation against our competitors in terms of execution and that execution showing up in the financials in terms of a healthy growth profile that we expect to see for some period and also profit generation and free cash flow generation coming up this year that we're very very excited about. So thanks everyone for joining and we'll talk to you next quarter.,0.003344417,0.003533959,0.000134245

84,84,CB,Greenberg:,First of all let me work backwards and then I'm going to come to the first part because let's be precise with each other. First of all Merck. Merck was not a cyber insurance policy. Merck was a property insurance policy. And I wish those who are thinking about this or writing about this externally would put their heads around that that it was property insurance not cyber insurance huge difference. And I hope that helps you. Secondly when you started by saying am I seeing anything there in cyber what do you mean am I seeing anything there? Help me and then I'll help you.The largest single factor territory of attack into the United States for the last number of years has been Russia. Clearly when it comes to ransomware attack more comes out of Russia than any other jurisdiction in the world. In fact China is not a source of that. China's more a source of espionage. And so it hasn't abated and it hasn't increased actually from what we see. And when we talk to the experts those in the cybersecurity industry there are certain changes of patterns that I won't go into. But overall it was a hostile environment and it continues to be in that regard. It has a certain frequency and severity signature to it. We haven't seen anything systemic. And I think you probably know that because otherwise you'd have been reading about it in the New York Times.In which businesses?No. Pricing doesn't really change. It's very independent of interest rate environment. This is not long -- this is not savings-oriented business. For the most part it is fundamentally a risk business. It's a morbidity business to be clear and the vast majority of it. Think about supplemental health-related dread-disease related there is an element of ROP of which is a return to premium power. It has a savings element to it. But that is -- that's a filed rate and it changes very slowly. So no it's not an interest -- to put it in a word Meyer it's not an interest-sensitive business.No it has not. We have 20-some-odd percent market share in crop in the United States. That's a huge tanker. That thing moves pretty slowly if you're thinking about change and exposure which in that sense you'd be thinking about change in mix of crop. You'd be thinking about territory change. And the only change in mix of crop comes in the aggregate to the degree that farmers change their behaviors and it aggregates to something significant like a change from corn to soybeans et cetera. But we generally see that most every year a bit of that on the margin.Always looking for that. But no there was nothing -- it was just a mix and an anomalous in the quarter. It bounced around a little bit as you know.Yes. I -- and I gather you're talking about the industry Brian my view of it not Chubb.I don't have a firm view about it a clear view. I would say on one hand cost of capital has gone up. And so the bar goes up. Most companies or lot of companies their balance sheet learning powers are in pretty good shape. And most of the M&A in the industry in my mind cloaked in the word strategic is actually more done out of weakness where people feel pressured and they want to continue growth. They have a balance sheet whole problem et cetera. And I don't see a lot of impetus for M&A in a broad sense. And there's more risk in the environment right now remember that. And so people will be a little cautious. You'll see -- where you'll see it will be more in small and midsized I doubt you'll see much in anything of a large size but who the heck knows.,0.002479881,0.002538204,5.83E-05
85,85,CI,Cordani:,Good morning A.J. it's David. In some ways it's early -- in other ways the trend is upon us right? We're seeing the convergence which is a net positive. We think it's a net positive from a -- standpoint relative to the opportunity to further improve affordability. And given our Evernorth model we have the services with Evernorth and some leverage relative to Cigna Healthcare to really harness this opportunity on a go-forward basis. We don't think there's a single influent point that exists. Maybe that's inferred in your comment. So it's not as though 2023 or 2025 is the single year we see a ramping of activity. And our teams as you would expect are working class-by-class drug-by-drug with manufacturers as well as with the programs that we will have in place. And the choices we will be able to offer our clients. I think very importantly the consultative nature of the way Evernorth supports our clients will be even more pronounced and more beneficial with the biosimilar trends as it evolves. As you would expect given the energy we have relative to our specialty portfolio and its respective traction this will be an area weâ€™ll seek to amplify a bit more specifically at our Investor Day. But suffice to say there's not a singular inflection point 2023 is an important year with some convergence but 2024 2025 begin to ramp and beyond. So we're well positioned relative to that to improve affordability for our clients and customers and have Evernorth benefit from the value it's creating for our clients customers and patients.Good morning Gary. It's David. Let me start and then ask Brian to talk a little bit more relative to the Evernorth growth framework and why Scripts are I think an important example but given the breadth of Evernorth no longer the sole example that you should be looking at. Specific to your framing relative to the current year broadly speaking I think your walk-in faming is right. There was -- we had a little lower retention rate than our historic average and clearly lower than our phenomenal 2019 and 2020 retention level from that standpoint. Your question I think goes to 2023 and as I noted we're positioned to have another strong growth year for 2023 for Evernorth both on a new business and on a renewal basis. Now specific to PBM before I transition over to Brian to talk a little bit more relative to the Evernorth growth we're right at about a 90% visibility. So about 90% of the books already renewed which is good at this point in time of the year and we feel quite strong relative to that. And as we sit here right now specific to the PBM portion of Evernorth which is what you're asking about we expect our retention to be higher than 2022â€™s retention level and revert back to more of the historic norm of 95% or a bit better from that standpoint. But importantly 90% of the book is renewed and we still have some active selling that sits in front of us right now because the marketplace continues to be pretty fluid in the current environment. Brian?Good morning Lisa. Good to chat with you this morning. So there's a couple of different I think flavors to your question. Let me try to be succinct as I can with them. First the whole person health or the coordination of care and services remains mission-critical and as we've learned as a society has been amplified in this COVID environment. So first by way of background we continue to expand access to behavioral services whether it's expanding a network in a traditional sense whether it's expanding behavioral services through virtual care whether it's being the first have virtual care capabilities be covered as in-network services through the likes of Ginger. But then the next step is how do you coordinate point solutions like that and bring them together. And so let's walk that across MDLIVE. MDLIVE is a great example and we couldn't be more pleased by having that asset as part of the company to be able to innovate off of because MDLIVE underscores as a symbol our view and commitment that harnessing technology and data to bring more services on a real time highly personalized basis to a patient or individual presents one of the biggest opportunities in front of our society for the coming years. And specifically as you take virtual care and you coordinate medical behavioral pharmacy services et cetera and coordinate those services patients benefit at a significant level. As we click it down another notch we've seen some disruption in the marketplace but I would remind you that our model is not a B2C model dependent upon B2C activation only building off of a triage of it. Or is more B2B and then cultivating the relationship with the customer whether it's through an employer a health plan or a health care professional organization and then end with a fact to underscore our MDLIVE volumes year-over-year Q1 2021 versus Q1 2022 we're up about 29%. So an area where we have significant conviction being able to again coordinate point solutions as opposed to just push point solutions and having it be highly patient-centric in real time represents a tremendous opportunity and we're pleased with our progress thus far.Yes. So Lisa I'm sorry I didn't touch upon that. And you're right we will touch upon that at Investor Day. So I'll just try to what your appetite by saying absolutely we see tremendous opportunity. So when you think about it the leverage between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare's portfolio we already have significant proof points and traction relative to that and there's more opportunity that Eric and our colleagues will walk through when we're at Investor Day. But importantly those services are not limited to Cigna Healthcare everything we're building within Evernorth is built with an eye toward yes Cigna Healthcare as a client to improve quality and affordability and we'll walk through proof points relative to that. But simultaneously to be able to bring it to market to stand-alone employer relationships that minor serves our health plan clients integrated delivery systems et cetera on a go-forward basis. So we see that addressable market underscoring your point to be quite broad quite large in terms of what we're building and the ability to improve affordability personalization and clinical quality whether it's for Cigna Healthcare or other relationships present a tremendous opportunity and we will amplify that Investor Day.Justin you're live but you have different names. So you have an alias this morning. It's good to hear your voice.Good morning Kevin it's David. Before we get into the Kaiser opportunity which I will. I remind you that we talk about a strategic imperative in the company that we referred to. Our objective as we seek to be the undisputed part of choice. Why do we say that? Because we're guided by a tenant that suggests that if we could identify alignment with potential partners which I'll come back to Kaiser we could have the opportunity together to create more value. More reach more service more affordability more clinical quality. So specific to Kaiser that fits into the category and we could not be more excited and pleased with the opportunity to partner up with Kaiser It represents a multiyear strategic relationship where we together can improve access value and affordability. And as I noted in my prepared remarks it builds on a successful track record with organizations like Prime Therapeutics where we'll look at a totally different organization with the Department of where we successfully renewed both Prime Therapeutics in the Department of Defense and expanded relationships are recently UPMC et cetera. So it's an orientation relative to collaborating in a different way and leveraging not only Evernorth's capabilities but in many cases the Cigna Healthcare capabilities. So as it relates to the core of your question in 2022 I would not view it as a major top line or bottom driver given the size and breather Corporation. But as we've proven with other relationships we see it as an opportunity that will have significant and attractive growth over the coming years as we collaborate together and co-innovate together for both top line and bottom line which will be reinforcing of growing in relationships. So I'd ask you to put in the category of a an orientation and a long track record of successful partnerships and we could not be more pleased to partner up with Kaiser and build some shared capabilities and innovation to serve clients and customers with better affordability and reach make clinical quality.Sure George. No doubt the environment has remained active. As you noted from a state as well as federal standpoint we do not see any one item I think underlying your question do we see any one item or one theme as a de-railer relative to our business strategy or capabilities? No. And more macro we are aligned around initiatives that seek to further improve affordability. All aspects of what we do day in day out within our pharmacy services portfolio are to drive the right level of differentiated affordability of course with clinical and service quality always matched up against that and we're quite proud of what we've been able to do. And I would note just as an example it seems like just yesterday but it's actually three years ago we launched our patient assurance program for insulin customers. And today we have 10 million customers in the patient assurance program just three years later. And the patient assurance program was uniquely designed at that time and still differentiated in the marketplace. The caps a 30-day outlay for an individual customer at $25. So more broadly to your question it is active. We do not see any one item as a rally relative to our strategy rather the breadth of our services capabilities funding mechanisms and our approach relative to integrating services we see as creating more opportunities than not as we seek to innovate and redefine the way we're able to bring those services to market.Ricky good morning it's David. I'll take your first question. I'll ask Brian to take your second question. Specifically the first question comes back toward care delivery and I think underscoring that is primary care delivery in the marketplace. Our orientation today relative to care delivery more broadly is we seek to own and differentiate in target areas within care delivery. Those areas include virtual care specialty pharmacy care and services aspects of behavior health care and services aspects of home health care services. We see these as sustainable differentiated services that can be leveraged and coordinated. And in many cases function on a nationalized basis or a more seamless basis across multiple geographies. As it relates to physical primary care outside of say virtual care which would have primary in it but physical primary care our stated strategy remains we seek to partner with and enable health care professionals with aligned incentive models in our care coordination services and that continued to perform -- that strategy has continued to perform very well for us both in a capital-light service orientation but in the shared collaboration as underscored by our sustained differentiated medical cost trend in clinical quality and NPS we've been able to deliver. Lastly I would say Ricky that as we've noted in the past we are willing to own as we do in a select MSA in the Southwest. We are willing to own primary care physical assets. If we conclude that the only way to get the right balance of affordability access and quality is through ownership but our preferred approach is again to partner and enable and that has served us well for quite some time while we seek to differentiate ourself in virtual specialty pharmacy behavioral and home care. Brian I'll ask you to pick up on Humira.Dave good morning it's David. I'll take both your questions. First I would not call out the slice phenomenon whether it's slicing or consolidate as a major driver specifically as it relates to 2022. The phenomenon transpires as clients look for additional value and as they seek additional value. I'd underscore though a little bit of a subset here that may be inferred in your question. As we've all learned throughout the prolonged pandemic where people live and work continues to be more fluid than ever. Hence having the seamless network access care coordination and service capabilities that are truly national and again seamless remains a differentiator. And like a few -- I'm not going to say Cigna is no one like a few that proposition I think is even more important today than ever before in terms of supporting the marketplace. But I would not call it the slice phenomenon is unique. As it relates to the Medicaid redeterminations first in our 2022 outlook or our multiyear strategy stand today we do not have a big uptake that would be planned for relative to redeterminations. We do think we'll be a net beneficiary. There'll be some that plays through. And whether it shows up in our IFP or exchange business or in our commercial portfolio through the mechanisms in which people access care or services we do believe that we'll see some opportunity in it but we do not have that factored into our outlook. And we do not believe that you have to be a Medicaid player to benefit from that. We've seen seamlessness of individuals moving over a prolonged period of time even pre-pandemic between programs. So that phenomenon as it relates to the redetermination and the way in which people seamlessly move between either Medicaid and exchange or whether they move between Medicaid through a redetermination now to a broader commercial population we do not see Medicaid as a gate. So that presents some potential upside for us going forward.Again thank you for joining our call today. Just to reinforce a few points we achieved strong results in the first quarter and we're stepping into the rest of 2022 with momentum. We're confident that we will deliver our increased EPS outlook of at least $22.60 for 2022. Our performance is a direct result of the hard work dedication and passion of our more than 70 000 coworkers across our company who work every day to change people's life for the better. Our actions are also guided by our drive to make healthcare more affordable predictable and simple for our clients and our customers as well as our patients. We look forward to talk to you more next month at our Investor Day about our vision for the future and the progress we're making in driving a meaningful impact for those we serve as well as our long-term sustained growth outlook. Hope you have a great rest of your day.,0.0029846,0.004025757,0.000498539
86,86,ZTS,Peck:,Great. Mike I'll take the first part of it which is the broader livestock trends and then Wetteny can take the DRAXXIN and the field force question that you've got. I mean look as you know well historically livestock has grown around 4% I think if you look at 2019 and 2020 you saw sort of some unusual events that affected overall industry livestock growth. Obviously African Swine Fever in China as you remember and then overall COVID but then as I think as you look at 2021 and 2022 Zoetis has been unusually impacted and that has everything to do with where DRAXXIN is. And Wetteny can get into the numbers but that has played out exactly how we expected it to. Our long-term outlook as Wetteny mentioned a few minutes ago in his prepared remarks remains unchanged. We think you're going to start to go back to more normalized growth in 2023 and beyond basically because feeding the world is a powerful trend the desire for protein and higher quality protein. But let me let Wetteny get into some of the specifics on the DRAXXIN numbers and then your second question.Sure. Thanks Jon. I'll start with the first question and let Wetteny take the second. With regard to Librela no this is exactly as we expected. We were expecting an approval later this year. We continue to expect that as we wrote in the market there's no change there. We still require an ex-U.S. site visit as we said all along. So I would say there's really no update there. And to your second question when would you expect a launch? We're obviously as we would in any product working to build up supply. But as always in our industry and especially with regards to biologics and monoclonal antibodies the standard in our industry is it takes somewhere between three and 9 months to get up to a full launch. So is a monoclonal antibody. We'll do an early experience sometime in the first half again depending on when the approval is and launch shortly thereafter. We're quite excited about this. Obviously we're working hard to build up that supply as soon as we get the approvals of the site et cetera. So everything on Librela is exactly where we were before really absolutely no change there.Sure. I'll start on the overall derm. As you saw it grew about 28% in the quarter driven by expanding our direct efforts. Certainly you see we're investing more in our field force pet care rewards. I also think genuinely it's just more people home with their pets. I don't have the specific share numbers. We can certainly get back to you on that I think it's over 70% in the U.S. our share of the atopic dermatitis allergic dermatitis markets overall in the U.S. and especially it's even more if you want to look at revenue. But we're really pleased with where that's going. With regards to competition I know our favorite question we don't absolutely know. We would expect competition on it. At this point in time as we look at 2022 we are not expecting competition in 2022 we would expect it in 2023. As our latest intelligence obviously we could be wrong there. But expectation is competition for derm on a small molecule basis will come in 2023. With regards to our own pipeline internally we don't discuss that. So I don't think we have any color there. But I don't know Wetteny do you want to take the second question?Sure. Thanks Chris. Good to hear from you. As you think about the economic challenges potential economic risk across the globe I think one thing you've seen about the animal health industry I was referencing before the research is 86% will spend what it takes. And I think it's also really important to focus on the fact that our companion animal business is growing 50% between 2019 and 2021. As Wetteny mentioned it was about 63%. And that is just a more durable business as you think about getting through economic challenges. We grew through the beginning of COVID for example. As you look at it we've grown during the Great Recession. And that was when our companion animal business was only 35%. So I think structurally if you look at our business it's more positive now than it was during the Great Recession so I do think we're going to be pretty resilient as we go through those times. But I'll let Wetteny add anything wants to and then take your protein demand trend question.Sure. I mean I guess what we would say is that you're seeing more animals you're seeing Wetteny's mentioned the demographics of who is adopting these animals people who spend more time more money on them the aging of pets. So I'm not sure we would probably parse the data the way you do to be perfectly honest. Obviously we are seeing increased compliance. I think alternative channels sort of online and autoship even from clinics is really helping driving that increased compliance. But I would say if you look at our portfolio it's innovation. It's bringing disruptive innovation that people are excited about looking at Paris a single product that does three things. people are excited about. You look at monoclonal antibodies. You look at dermatology. We have great chronic medications that are not as susceptible to how many visits you make. If you get a prescription for par it lasts the year. So I guess we would look at the data slightly differently than what you're looking at it. And more importantly for our business we think the nature of our business and the level of innovation and the demographics of both the number of animals and who's adopting them remains very positive.Sure. Thanks Elliot. Great questions on Librela. We are super excited at the launch there. To get to some of the specific information you have for us. As we said this is now Librela in Europe is now the number one selling product for pain. What's really exciting also about that is 40% are patients that are new to the category. So I think this is really changing the game for a lot of people maybe for safety reasons couldn't take what the other products were are really coming into the vet clinic. And to get to your other question there's a 90% reorder rate. So which gets that -- if you come in for one injection are you staying with the product? The answer is yes. And this is why we believe in its first full year in Europe alone Librela will be a blockbuster product for us. We did about $22 million in Q1. This definitely does inform as we think about U.S. launch. It informs why we want to start with early experience getting each of the best especially the KOLs used to what it looks like. How to treat how to manage it. And then really building that excitement which worked incredibly well for us in Europe which will do again in the U.S. And really I think our expectations for the product have increased based on the success weâ€™ve seen already. So Solensia we are very excited as well. It's a very different market it didn't exist before. As we talked about we're really creating the market as what is demonstrated time and again. It's ability to do that as it in derm. But again you got to get the cast to the clinic as you know there are less medicals lives than dogs. You've got to help cat owners know what pain looks like. But we remain super excited about Solensia. It will just be as we said the ramp will look slightly different on Solensia than it does with Librela. But we're just as excited and we think it's potential is very strong there. Do you want to add anything Wetteny?Great. Thank you all for your questions and for the continued interest in Zoetis. I just want to summarize I think Zoetis is off to a strong start of the year. We've got continued strength in products for pet care and I think as you've seen a diverse and durable global portfolio we're really happy to be maintaining our operational growth expectations for the full year despite the negative impact of foreign exchange and other headwinds. And we're continuing to make ongoing investments in talent and technology manufacturing expansions and innovation that have us well positioned to support our future growth plans as well. So I look forward to keeping you updated on future calls and hope you have a great day. Thanks so much everybody.,0.002598837,0.003081441,0.000286133
87,87,MO,Mancuso,: Sure. So I'll take those questions in order. First I guess the way I'd respond to your initial question is that it's critical for us that we continue to manage a strong balance sheet going forward. As you know last year in part of our capital allocation we did do some tender refinancing of debt which extended maturities of low interest debt. We're pleased with the results of that transaction. And part of the way we manage the balance sheet is we manage our debt towers going forward so that we're less impacted by market dynamics and we have the ability to have flexibility in how we treat maturing debt. So I'm not going to forecast out necessarily how we'll handle that debt that's coming to maturity. But of course we will do the analysis and determine the best way to handle that whether it's paid off with existing cash or think about refinancing as such. And the same answer goes for the euro debt that's coming through -- that's coming due. We'll do the analysis. You are correct in that it is a natural hedge against the ABI dividends that we receive. And we do have flexibility to think about being how we can be opportunistic across various markets whether we're thinking about managing our balance sheet going forward or refinancing or managing debt as it comes due.: There's really nothing new to say. We continue to perform the analysis related to our ABI stake. As we spoke about in our opening remarks it's a financial investment. Our focus is on maximizing that investment for the long-term shareholder value. We continue to do the analysis and there's nothing new to report on the asset itself.,0.003104091,0.003104091,0
88,88,SO,Fanning:,Well we think is enormous and we are so lucky to have people on our Board that are well steeped in it. I mean we have former Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz we have Dale Klein former Chairman of the NRC. Kristine Svinicki former Chairman of the NRC. All these people have classification status to be able to play in this information in an unfiltered way. You all obviously know my role. I've led the utility industry for eight years and turn that over to my good friend at Berkshire Hathaway Bill Furman and now I chair the CISA Advisory Board. Listen this is an enormous issue. I was the only CEO private citizen on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. As I walk the halls of Congress which I do as frequently as anybody I guess it's clear to me that there is bipartisan recognition of the importance of this issue and what we need to do about it. Unfortunately there was no playbook. When the Cyberspace Solarium Commission came out with its report I think it's been universally adopted in Congress. Of course not every chapter was agreed to but 70% of that commission's recommendations are now in law. And I'm so glad now that I get to help in operationalizing primarily now with CISA and elsewhere with our own industry. But making this stuff come to fruition. The United States is making enormous strides and making ourselves safer. We will only do that as we reimagine the role of the private sector in preserving our national security. I think we're making terrific progress with that. And I want to give two shout-outs. First one is Jen Easterly She's the Director of CISA. She does just a terrific job operationalizing the nation's cybersecurity agency. And then our National Cyber Director in the White House Chris Inglis just a brilliant guy in my wandering around before the Solarium Commission became to fruition he and I got together and I found a real thought partner in how to advance the nation. Look we have talent on our Board. We have talent inside the company. And I think the nation is operationalizing a real plan to make our national security better than it ever has been. A whole lot more to go but man o man as a nation we're better off than we were five years ago.Look first of all we're starting from a great spot I mean overall our rates relative to the national average bounce around anywhere from 10% to 15% below national averages. So we're starting from a good place. We've got incredibly constructive mechanisms that help not only capture what's coming so it's all forward-looking mechanisms that are also very kind of the cadence of them is thought out very well.You bet. Always good talking with you.Hey Jeremy thanks for joining us.No it's really the nature of the work to perform. And I wouldn't say it's difficulty per se. It certainly has different time requirements. And like I say the lumpiness is driven by the systems that will be completed right before we ask for the 103G letter. If I had to characterize those I would say of the 30 to 40 roughly half of that deals with our final electrical work a quarter of it deals with ventilation systems and a quarter of it deals with as you would expect the final primary controls and monitoring systems. Once you finish that work then you file your letter. It's just that as you do that work it's just a big slug of ITaC that go out with it. Again it's not a matter of degree of difficulty. It's more a matter of timing.Yes. And you should also I think -- CNBC put my interview out on their website so you can go look at it. What we have seen is a migration of people into the Southeast particularly Georgia. I think Georgia has the fifth highest growing population in the United States. And there's this question of well are we going to have a recession? You may have a different way to ask the question and that would be regional recessions we don't see any data that supports recession in the Southeast at this point. Let me give you some other data it's just interesting. If you look at our industrial sales year-over-year it was up 1.7%. I mean you guys know that's a good number okay? But within that number we're two of our three biggest single-site plants closed. One was a chlor-alkali plant and one was a newsprint plant. If you remove the effect of those plants from the new brander and denominator our industrial sales were up over 4.5%. I mean that's amazing stuff. So I think especially as Dan suggested with the ports you see the unwinding of supply chain you see the migration of people in you see the low unemployment rate. I think the chemicals are in the sea for something to crawl up on the beach that will be sustainable and positive for years to come. And certainly if there is a global downturn and if there is a widespread recession. As we have seen in the past the Southeast will be more resilient. The downturn will be less severe and the emergence from that downturn probably will be quicker. So I can't predict the future. All I can say is relative to the United States I love the organic economic growth in our area.Hey Paul. Always glad to have you with us.Yeah it is part of that process. And yes it's still underway but it certainly is winding down.Yes. Everything that we're putting out is consistent with the time frames. We're in good shape there I think.Is that your dog in the background?All right. Nice dog.Its not so much found. Sometimes it was incomplete. Sometimes it was absent. We've basically wound down that work. There may be a few left to go but nearly all are done for 103G. And for those that are required to load fuel I think we're 75% of the way there. So there's still some work to be done but it's not associated largely with 103G. It's more associated with the work I described for fuel load.Next week I think. They've already posted some stuff on their website. So â€“ and we've already had our debrief with the NRC.Thank you sir.Hey Nicholas. Thanks for joining us.Yeah yeah Nick there's more work to be done. You should not expect us to get 103G and load fuel immediately. There is more work to be done. So there will be some space in between yeah I know we have this chart that shows 103G letter received and start fuel load almost immediately. I would expect if I were you. If we got the 103G letter sooner there would still be a gap of time to get to fuel load.Yeah sure. We absolutely are. In fact we've resequenced some work. Some stuff we mentioned in the past was energization of the control room and things like that. We moved that out. We've really been focused. Early on and I think it was really smart. The site wanted to fail fast if you will. And complete testing as soon as we were able in order to learn from whatever problems that arose and then be able to apply them critically. Now that we have a set of learnings at Unit 3 I think we have a better sense as to how to proceed on Unit 4 incorporating those learnings. And so you will see that in the Unit 4 progression.Well actually I think our gas business fits in well with the decarbonization. When you think about the whole effort of energy policy in America we have to make sure that we balance all of the clean safe reliable and may be resilient and affordable objectives okay? So you could say oh well we should eliminate all natural gas appliances in a home eliminate gas heating. Well in Illinois that makes no sense at all. Who could afford to do that? And the electricity substitution effects in places like Illinois make no sense compared to the economies that our customers get through gas heat and other approaches like cooking and others. So what we have to do is take into account the full range of impacts to customers clean safe reliable affordable. And we've got to come up with a global solution on how to achieve those objectives and achieve net-zero. I think we're doing that. I think the idea somehow that gas should go away in America is really foolish. Don't undersell the capability of American technology innovation in solving the problem of the future. And when I talk about a new relationship where we want the Department of Energy broadly the United States government to get in the boat with us to achieve this net-zero goal. Some of that may be funding more important net zero technologies whether that's storage whether that is carbon removal whether it's new nuclear you name it. We are by far I think the biggest proprietary research and development shop in America. We're one of the biggest funders of a -- Former Vice Chair. We've had several chairs. I think Stan Conley [ph] is now starting his second chairmanship of that effort. I think we're by far the biggest energy partner in technology development with DOE. Look what we need to do with the nation is invest in technology innovation and solve these problems. Saying that given today's state of nature we can't do gas in the future is foolish given the amount of gas the plentiful supply and the geopolitical national security interest we have in providing that. And now that geopolitical interest is not just parochial for the United States now that Russia has weaponized their gas supply to Europe how can Europe ever feel secure and having them as a trading partner. We need to step up to the plate and help solve the global problem here. The old idea was that Thomas Friedman the world is flat or whatever that is the world is not flat. It's full of perturbation and we may see a new global economy emerge where there are countries that are aligned with our national interest and perhaps those that aren't. And we'll see how that evolves. But boy-o-boy it's clear to me from a supply chain standpoint commodity development standpoint energy can be one of the most important economic development activities the United States can do not only to keep things cheap and plentiful here but provide us national security around the globe.ThanksSrinjoy great to have you with us.And its risk profile and its earnings profile is all consistent with what we think we have here long-term contracts creditworthy counterparties bilateral minimal to no fuel or transmission risk those kinds of things.Go ahead.And I'll just complement Dan's team. You look at our portfolio I think we have it in the background material but 18-year average life 3.5 kind of average coupon. This is one of the more valuable debt portfolios in the United States. It is a real asset to us.Thank you sir.Well my only closing remark will be thank you all for joining us. We're off to an awfully good start this year certainly in our financials in our base business but also with plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. We continue to work very hard to execute happy so far this year. We'll continue to work hard for the rest of the year and bring this thing home. Thanks everyone for joining us.,0.157575941,0.367164135,0.158943124
89,89,TMUS,Sievert:,"One of the things -- reasons I made my joke at the beginning is you were asking about all of our growth objectives. And before we ask Peter to wrap up on wireline I just want to remind everybody that what you just heard from the team is that we are absolutely on track with the bold aspirations that we shared now more than a year ago with you as we laid out our multiyear plan on this business. And what's interesting about us that makes us so different as a growth bet is that we have a rational articulated growth strategy based on proven areas of underpenetration where we know we have opportunity and where we are making down payments and are very much on track. And that's what investors should be asking us about. So I just want to make sure everybody is reminded that we have major underpenetrated opportunities in small markets and rural areas 40% of this country where we've already grown from 13% to 15% share and we're tracking beautifully. We have major underpenetrated segments in business a huge part of this marketplace and probably growing in the wake of the pandemic where we're very underpenetrated and where Callie just reminded us our present performance would get us to those multiyear aspirations. We articulated a huge opportunity in high-speed Internet and now 2 quarters in a row have showed you that we're the nation's fastest-growing broadband provider. Our top 100 markets where we lead the industry are also a big opportunity. And you're going to hear us talking more and more about the growth trajectory that we see with prime consumers and quality seekers in the top 100 markets. Despite our leadership there are tens of millions of people in the top 100 markets who've never given T-Mobile a serious look because they want the best network. Now that we offer that there's a huge opportunity for us to unlock there and you'll be hearing more about that. And then finally Sprint integration. I already told you that Sprint integration is a growth tailwind. If Sprint was churning like T-Mobile we'd be at 900 000 phone net adds this quarter. And we're making the progress that we promised you with one of the biggest sequential churn reductions this industry has ever seen our best one in 7 years a whopping 17 basis points quarter-over-quarter all on the strength of executing like we said we would on a major growth trajectory. So that's one thing I want to make sure to remind people about. And then finally big question was about wireline what's going on there? What are the opportunities that we see? What were you really talking about?Okay. Terrific. Before we go back to the phones obviously we've got questions coming in on Twitter. We usually get interesting ones from Bill Ho. I see one want to hear Neville about network. It looks like we're up again in 5G reach out to 315 million people. Where is that really going? And where are we on ultra-capacity 5G? Can you forecast for us what to expect there because that's the real game.It's very interesting what's happening here. You've heard us say before that we see that we're 2 years ahead in the 5G race now. And 2 years from now we'll be 2 years ahead in the 5G race. And that's not a quip that's not a competitive quip. That's actually an aspiration that we take very serious. And you just heard Neville say that by the end of this year we'll reach 260 million people with Ultra Capacity. That's an aspiration that Verizon has by the end of '24 except only 250 million. But by the end of next year we'll be at 300 million. And what's interesting is our goal is that in many places it's not just to have 300 million people deployed but in many places to have fully 200 megahertz of 5G dedicated spectrum. That's remarkable in terms of what we can do to change customers' experiences on smartphones to serve enterprises government customers and of course broadband and other new applications. And so that's our aspiration. We take it very seriously. And one of the things you should judge us on is have we been through over and over and over again to the things that we said we would go do. Because we've been very clear-eyed about this strategy for many years and I think that consistency is something that people should acknowledge.Absolutely. I'll start and then I'll ask Jon Freier to jump in and maybe Neville as well. I'll remind you of a couple of things that we've said in the past and something I said in my prepared remarks. What we do for this 40% of the country we call it our precision playbook. We've divided that segment of the country into 775 submarkets. And what we do is study our relative competitiveness. And so it starts with the network. Is our network every place people in that local area need for us to believe that we have all the factors of success required to win market share. Now this is observable because we are number one in many places in this country. We know what it takes. And we take that same observable logic and we apply it now to places we were never highly competitive. And what we've said in our upfront remarks is that we believe we are competitive across about 30% of those places the POPs represented by those places. And that will be competitive across about 50% by the end of this year. Now I'll guide you. There are some layers of competitiveness. That's sort of our base level and above. And there's levels that we can get to above that. But we measure that number because what we see is when we have that level of competitiveness what we call right to win we are able to see win shares in line with our aspirations such that we know that the price that we promised you is within reach. And that's really important. So again we're in those 30% of POPs where we already have a right to win we are winning. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in this strategy. We'll be at 50% by the end of this year. And maybe Jon you can talk about what's going on as we enter each of these markets what formula we bring to make sure that we get the win share that's required for us to grow our market share.A lot of times our breakthroughs come from willingness to lead things in an unconventional way like with team of experts a few years ago and Jon just told you about another big breakthrough management concept that we've fully implemented across the country that we think is a big part of our I guess now not so secret sauce. Great. And by the way so before we go back to the phones Neville back to you. There's a question from Tech Life Channel Techlife32 What's going on with those 10 000 new sites because 5G coverage is great but what about coverage? So what's happening with our promised site expansion? And while you're at we did say in our prepared remarks where we are on decommissioning. This is the year of decommissioning. We expect to complete the task this year. Maybe you can give an update on how that's going too.Neville and his team are very busy. This is as you know the peak capital year in our business plan. And we have teams that are upgrading literally hundreds and hundreds of sites every single week. In a year we're going to simultaneously reach 260 million people with Ultra Capacity 5G while completing the shutdown of the Sprint network well and ahead of our schedule. So it's a -- and we're very much on track. And it's fantastic to see the team's execution in every part of this country.Great. I'll start with the second one and then hand it to Peter on the first one. We are delighted with what we're seeing this year on Sprint customer response to everything happening on the network and service and plan front; and you can see it in our results. So one of the things we -- I mentioned a little while ago is that right now we're substantially complete with about 37% of the customers bringing them what I'll call all the way across. Now the vast majority of our customers are on the T-Mobile network now almost all their traffic is on the T-Mobile network now. We'll be moving to shut down the Sprint network this year. But we have a lot of work to do to make sure that the customers come across with T-Mobile plans T-Mobile phone plans no remaining leases on their line and all of their traffic on the T-Mobile side. When those things happen churn is the same. And we have achieved that milestone now for about 37% of the Sprint base. And that's much higher than it was just a few months ago. And so you see the result in the sequential churn improvement because as more and more people achieve that level more and more of them churn just like T-Mobile churn was. And that's what unfolded over the last quarter. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in our plan. I want to make sure that people don't connect it though to something happening just 2 months from now. I mean when we shut down the Sprint network it's not just the network traffic. The network traffic is already on T-Mobile. It's the whole thing getting them migrated to the right plan the right service structure and importantly getting them on a T-Mobile phone payment plan and making sure there's no more leases because those are sources of dissatisfaction. And that's where we're at 37%. It will take us some time to stepwise move through the base. But what we know is that when we do they love T-Mobile on the other hand and they churn like the lowest-churning brand over the last 2 years. And so that's fantastic. And then specifically to your first question we'll turn it to Peter on the cost of services.It's nice to see things unfolding the way we predicted. We're very much on track for the $7.5 billion. We increased the in-year synergy attainment with this guidance. And of course that results in also an increase in cash flows to 30% year-over-year cash flows in the present guidance. So terrific to see that happening. Listen we promised you a 1-hour call. And so with apologies to those still in the queue many of whom I'm really sorry we didn't get to because we love you but we'll take the last question operator.Let me start with Neville and supply chain and then I'll wrap things up with an answer to your question Simon.Simon I'm glad you asked that because your question goes -- in my mind it goes right to the heart of what a lot of people want to know about this sector right now. And I would characterize it really in terms of 2 important questions people have. One is there room for everybody? What's going -- can this growth continue? What's going to go on when the growth slows down? And if it slows down will it get unhealthily competitive? Those are the big questions I think on people's minds. And I got to tell you I'm not concerned about those questions. As I've said in the past first of all I think what we're seeing is some of that is happening in the dynamic right now out there. And in the very time frame when people are asking these questions they're asking """"Hey how are you going to navigate if things slow down?"""" We delivered 1.3 million postpaid net adds the best in 8 years more than AT&T and Verizon combined. In the very time frame when people are saying what about are things slowing down? How are you guys going to do if things slow down? And I love that you're asking that because it reminds everyone listening that this is a business with major underpenetrated growth opportunities that we are proving we know how to execute against. And that's why we reliably bring the performance quarter after quarter. And to the second question people have which is isn't it going to get crazy out there if there isn't room for everybody? Which is I don't know but I can tell you that the amount of competitiveness that we bring is consistent over time. We are the competition. We like it competitive. It's been relatively consistently competitive through our actions for years now. Customers and businesses are the beneficiaries. Right now the cost per unit in this industry is lower for consumers and businesses than it's ever been in a time when every other category has rising prices. We're driving ARPU improvements without price improvement. And we're bringing a level of competitiveness to this industry that's so exciting for consumers and businesses while delivering on financial performance that we promised you and then some. And so people have these 2 questions. Is there room for everybody? I don't know. That's not -- I'm not burdened with that. I can tell you that this quarter it looks like there is. Cables about to report I think they had a healthy quarter. We're going to see nice numbers there. Our telemetry has usually been pretty good at predicting what to see there. But we delivered an 8-year Q1 all-time almost high. And that shows you that our growth strategy has integrity and it's reliable safe quarter-after-quarter growth that comes in just like we promised you it would. And it comes in with a healthy industry and a dynamic where T-Mobile can achieve its cash flow aspirations. And so look we like it. We look at the industry. We know we play an important role as stewards of a healthy industry and we think it's a healthy industry. And whether or not it's a healthy industry it's going to be an industry that's healthy for T-Mobile. So you got to think that in all the time that you have we really appreciate you. Thanks for coming quarter after quarter with your great discussions. And we look forward to engaging with you more. Appreciate it.",0.142420207,0.877453685,0.301311473
90,90,ETN,Arnold:,Yes. Appreciate the recognition on that Nigel. You're absolutely right by the way. Q1 has historically always been a down quarter for Electrical. A lot of that is volume-related. And what we've seen historically in the business we typically see a seasonal volume reduction in Q1 versus Q4. And as a result margins on a decremental basis go down. And we are pleased the fact that they actually held up nicely in this Q1. But the biggest difference between I'd say the overall profitability level largely is we're doing a better job in managing price/costs overall. We did in fact in Q1 while still not out of the woods we did see a little better supply chain performance in Q1 around certain commodities that actually got a bit better in the quarter. And so I think it's really those 2 things: better price/cost achievement in the quarter and a little better supply chain performance from our suppliers.Yes. Appreciate once again. That did not call out as well in Aerospace really did have a very strong quarter and delivered very strong profitability overall. And I'd say in Aerospace it's really a function largely of where we're getting the growth. I mean aftermarket as you know and Aerospace had been depressed over the last number of years. And so we saw very strong growth in the aftermarket side of the Aerospace business. And aftermarket as you know carries a much higher profitability and we certainly would expect that to continue as we look forward. We also in Aerospace like in our other business did a better job of managing price versus input costs and getting price to offset inflation which was very helpful for the business. And then to your point on defense I'd say defense spending largely -- we're looking at a year today where it's on average flat to maybe up slightly. And we really think that the defense budgets as you think about the fiscal '23 defense budget for the U.S. and around the world certainly influenced we think also by what's happening today in the Ukraine. We think budgets are going up on the defense side of the business. And so we had a case assumption of what we thought defense market is going to look like over the next number of years. And we think that number is certainly going up given already public proclamations from many governments around the world around them increasing their defense spending. And so we think the Aerospace outlook although you hate to benefit from these kinds of events in the world but we'd certainly think defense spending is going to improve as we go forward. But it's largely going to be we think a 2023 story more than this 2022.Yes. I mean the short answer is yes and it's part of what's driving the strong growth that we're seeing in our aftermarket business. So absolutely.Yes. Thanks for the question Scott. I mean as you can imagine I mean there's just really large opportunities by various customers in different parts of the platform. And so yes we're winning content and we're also passing on content as well because we don't think it's going to deliver the returns that we expect as an organization. We're focused as I said on how do you distribute power how do you convert power and how do you keep it safe inside of the car. And so we are certainly being selective I'd say in terms of where we think we can participate in this growth in EV. As -- we talked about this goal that we set for creating a new leg inside of the company and the revenue goals that we set. That number could actually be much higher if we were going to be kind of less discriminate in trying to participate in every opportunity that's out there. So I'd say that this kind of $2 billion to $4 billion number that we put out there is really taken into consideration that we think there's going to be places where we have technology that allows us to differentiate to offer real value to the customers. And there's going to be other elements of what's happening in electrification that's more commoditized and we're going to stay away from the commoditized stuff and really focus on the places where we offer a differentiated technology-based solution. And that's -- those are the kinds of programs that we're winning. Those are the kinds of programs that we want to win.Oh the charging contract. Okay.Yes. So that's also true but I was thinking you were talking about the eMobility wins specifically. No I'd say on the charging contract specifically as I talked about it was -- unfortunately we're not at liberty to disclose the customer's name but it's one of the big names out there who today is helping build out the nation's charging infrastructure as the world moves to EVs. And once again I'd say that answer largely applies. I mean there are going to be clearly parts of what's going to happen in the context of charging infrastructure where there's going to be essentially a charger that doesn't have embedded intelligence where it doesn't require a lot of sophistication around the way you manage the load the energy required the energy consumed and how you balance the load. Let's call that dumb charging if you will. There's -- you plug it in and these electrons flow and it doesn't really require much intelligence in between. And so we're really not today participating in that end of the market. The places where we've decided to compete is where it really does require a fair amount of sophistication in terms of understanding what's happening behind the meter and how much electricity is available where you typically have multiple vehicles plugged in at the same time. So you have to make sure there's enough electricity available and you have to actually manage the charging in a very intelligent way. And that's where we once again think we bring the most value to the table and that's where we think we can make decent returns in that business.The way I think about it Julian and generally there's still -- as you guys know as well as us there's still a lot of uncertainties out there in the marketplace. Whether it's supply chain whether it's COVID-related shutdowns that are going on in China whether it's the downstream implications of the war in the Ukraine there is a lot of uncertainty that still exists in the marketplace. And so given where we sit today we just think it's prudent to say that let's be a little bit on the cautious side with respect to the outlook for the back half of the year. I mean the reality is if we end up with a better supply chain environment if the lockdowns in China resolve themselves more quickly than we anticipate that they will if the impacts of the war in the Ukraine are more contained than perhaps they are right now there could be certainly upside in the back half of the year. We just think at this juncture it's really not prudent to make those assumptions. And so we put in place a forecast that we think makes sense in the context of the current economic environment and the political environment that we're dealing in.Yes. And I'd tell you I mentioned that briefly in my comments in response to another question. I think today Deane if you -- every conversation I'm having with our distributor partners is that they all want more. I mean today inventory levels from where they sit are not where they'd like them to be. We continue to have challenges around today supporting all the demand. That's one of the reasons why certainly our backlog is growing the way it's grown principally in our Electrical businesses. And so I'd say today inventories in the channel are in better shape than they want them to be in with respect to they don't have enough. And so at this juncture I'd say we keep testing for that and make it to ensure that there isn't double ordering taking place and ensuring that people aren't putting provisional orders in the systems to get their place in line. But I can just tell you today based upon where inventories sit in respect to the outlook for the year inventory levels in the channel today are below and in some cases well below where they'd like them to be.Yes. I'd say it's still early days Deane. And we think it's another place where it's certainly needed. We think it's coming. But I'd say today even around the margins the utility markets I'd say like our markets in general are performing well. How much of that is tied specifically to grid hardening how much of that's tied to energy transition tough to really say and bifurcate the 2. But I'd say today we are certainly seeing strength in utility markets very much like we are in our other end markets as well.Yes. There's really not much to add Jeff to what we said. I mean clearly as we talked about the global segment we're certainly getting a benefit from better mix as industrial markets continue to rebound. As the Crouse-Hinds business -- global Crouse-Hinds business continues to rebound coming back to more historical levels of profitability that's certainly helping profitability in global. As I mentioned once again they're seeing less inflation in commodities. They're seeing fewer supply chain disruptions so fewer operational inefficiencies in their facilities as well than the Americas business. And so that's also part of the story of I'd say more of what's holding the Americas back like it's not even better than it is right now. But no I don't really think there's anything else going on. And certainly if you take a look at our outlook for the year we fully anticipate that the Americas business margins will be up some 120 bps this year and so it's going to be a good year.Yes. Appreciate the question. And as I mentioned in some of my commentary we are today with respect to backlog seeing some earlier orders perhaps on some projects than we would typically see them. But I'd say most of what we're experiencing in the backlog is it's fundamentally strengthening in the markets. The markets are strong and that's largely what's driving the backlog. We are today -- in the backlog there would be some orders that will certainly ship in 2023. Some of those are planned for 2023 for certain. But I'd say by and large the backlog coverage is as good as it's ever been in the history of the business. And so we have better visibility today into what's required wind than we ever have and don't feel like there's much in the backlog today that would be in any way a double order or not tied to a very specific project that we've somehow won in the marketplace.That win was -- the one we talked about specifically was in the first quarter. What we try to do is be pretty clean with respect to orders. And so anytime we talk about an order booked on these calls it will always be in the context of the order -- the quarter that we're talking about. But in terms of the profit the profitability of those businesses I think it's really -- it's early right? We're still in the early stages of -- fundamentally of the build-out the electrical charging infrastructure in general. But I'd say we have an expectation in the company and we have a standard in the company around what an attractive business looks like. And as we think about the way we bid projects and programs and the margin expectations we have no reason to believe that the margin expectation in EV charging infrastructure will be any different than the underlying profitability for our Electrical business.I think it's -- I mean as we think about the Q2 revenue guide at 10% we don't think that's in any way an aggressive number. If you just take a look at the growth in the backlog the growth in orders I mean that number could quite frankly be much higher if we had the ability to ship and satisfy all the demand that we're seeing in our businesses today. We are banking on the fact that we are going to see some modest improvements in supply chain and availability. But no that growth number is in no way an aggressive number in the context of the real underlying demand that we're seeing in our businesses. So we're very comfortable with the growth number in Q2.No. No I appreciate the question. But the way the electrical industry works and the business works in all of these projects tend to be in the theme of the total business relatively small. And so no it's -- we're seeing -- that's why one of the reasons we tried to give some color around the strength in end markets. If you think about today we talk about we serve commercial we serve utility we serve resi we serve data center we show -- we serve MOEM we serve industrial. So we serve all of these end markets. And I talked about in the Americas a range of growth in these end markets from 27% on the low end right to 36% on the high end. So every one of these markets are doing very well right now and none of our order growth would be tied to any particular one project. The only piece that tends to be a little bit lumpy is sometimes data centers is lumpy. When the hyperscale guys come in we've talked about that on some earlier calls. Sometimes they'll come in with some lumpy big orders and sometimes they'll take a quarter off. But for the most part we're seeing this broad-based strength.,0.003410796,0.005521655,0.000965377
91,91,PYPL,Togut:,All the best to you John.At the beginning of the pandemic Dan you clearly articulated a focus on unified commerce in particular a major rollout of QR codes at some of the biggest retailers in the country. And more recently we've seen consumers return to the physical point-of-sale with increased vaccination rates. Can you update us on how PayPal is positioned in unified commerce and in particular where you stand with the QR code rollout?,0.002418518,0.002418518,0
92,92,BSX,McKhann:,Yes. Now let me separate out two things. I think the bigger constraint we've seen has been more on the nurse side than on the physician side. And again these have been well documented and just in the types of settings I've mentioned. And I think the situation is improving but that's been coming out of COVID just a challenge for certain institutions. And I think like I said they're starting to get a handle on it and it's improving. On the physician side there is some movement but mostly for us it really is just a matter of continuing to train new users for -- across our products. And then doing as you said the leg work once someone is trained making sure they become totally comfortable with the devices and the procedures and expanding the different kinds of procedures they can use it for in the case of both OverStitch and X-Tack. And in the case of the Orbera side of things understanding how to really develop their practices and patient marketing some of those other areas where we're doing some of the co-marketing elements.Sure. We've -- we've been investing as Jeff mentioned in different aspects of growth. And so certainly are looking to continue to see that. We saw a good evidence of results of that in Q1 but I do expect to see that progress. And certainly to achieve our guidance range for the year we expect that to continue to step up and are focused on delivering on that. And that will be globally based to get things like some order patterns outside the US with some of our distributors as well. And so we feel good about a nice progression here and reiterating our guidance even with -- and Jeff alluded to this but just to be really clear we do have a bit of a headwind on the FX side more than most companies our size but are still focused on the guidance we've delivered and internally we want to exceed that.Sure. Yeah. No so for ESG and revise when we submitted to the FDA which was back in -- late in Q3 of last year we said that on average de novo 510(k) take about a year. That is average. There is -- there are wide error bars in those data because de novo 510(k) almost by definition have a little bit more uncertainty than a traditional 510(k). So it's a little hard to pinpoint. We are preparing for it and we hope to see that in the second half of the year and doing everything we can to support that process. The -- another big launch that we are working on clearly is the X-Tack launch outside the US. We have spoken on previous calls about there's a regulatory change in paradigm going on in Europe. There's a transition to the medical device regulations MDR. You guys may be familiar with your other med tech companies you follow as well. The net result of that is just things are taking longer. And so if we do see an impact it would be later in the year that we expect and we said that throughout that it's going to take a while. And then the Japan side for OverStitch we're very pleased to get the clearance. As I mentioned in my comments there's still some regulatory work to be done to really open up the market around OverStitch but it will I think on the margin have some positive impacts on our US business.Thank you.Yes Chris. We're excited to see the traction that some of these larger accounts are getting. And it's a mix in terms of the nature of the accounts. Some of them are not endobariatric. I mean they're just kind of broad-based users of across the portfolio some of the larger academic centers. But I would say the majority -- and this is -- it's a global list so inclusive of both the US and internationally are some of these early adopters are really embracing the endobariatric side of things. And so for that group that goes back to a bit of the homework we're doing on how they're approaching the markets right? They are seeing a really good response to frankly the procedures they're offering right between intragastric balloons and being a part of that for many of them not all but for most. But then also with the ESG and endoscopic revisions it's a nice affirmation for us that the value proposition resonates with patients. And that's true today even in a primarily cash pay environment or as I've mentioned before in the kind of case-by-case reimbursement situations that some have access to. But it's been really nice to see. And we will be excited at a time when we do have indication to say how do we support that or look to ways that others can follow in their footsteps.Yes I think there are a number of factors going on Chris. One is there is some things around for example both seasonality and some COVID impacts which impacts a bit of what you see in terms of those numbers. We also see as you move from an environment early on in the launch where a lot of it has to do with some stocking of new accounts and moving to true utilization. And so I think our utilization -- our underlying growth in utilization is probably a little higher from that standpoint. And then we're continuing I think in the kind of focus with our sales team of building that sustainable growth. And certainly we'd like to see continued and even improved quarter-on-quarter growth. And some of that is just some of the newer folks fully getting up to speed and delivering it and producing at the level we expect them to. So it's a big focus area for us to make sure we continue to sustain it. And I do think that additional clinical information and critical validation around X-Tack for example at DDW meeting will help a lot.Yeah. Thanks Colin. It's a little bit of all the above. You've kind of touched on a number of the things that we are in the process of doing and have been but I think are really emphasizing here. One it's not surprising that we have an established customer base that is more familiar in the upper GI and so really pushing our reps to move beyond kind of the established customers into a broader set. That is easier to do as we expand our team and they've got kind of smaller territories. And so we're absolutely doing that. We also have better targeting data with more recent clinical procedure numbers that allows them to be able to really focus on where the volumes are and make sure they're engaging the right physicians there. We're doing more in terms of engaging some of the key KOLs that really are the experts in the lower GI and having good -- very good experiences with some of them. But I do think the last piece around clinical data does matter. And so some of the data sets in colonic EMRs that I mentioned in my opening comments will be important. We don't know the outcomes of those studies but we -- anecdotally we've heard very good things about how people have done. So again once we certainly know the outcomes of what is presented and both presentations and posters at DDW being able to leverage that in those conversations. And a lot of the peer-to-peer kind of marketing is really important. I mentioned doing webcast and face-to-face just making sure people are hearing from their colleagues about how they are incorporating this new approach into their clinical practice. Inertia is a powerful thing in medicine and we're looking to change that.Sure. So we're kind of doing two things simultaneously. We've got our territory managers that typically are focused on selling each of the products. And especially as a new hire getting up to speed on the training around them the procedures supporting the accounts and focusing across all three products. In parallel Jeff and his comments on one of the slides we've mentioned this newer role of what we're calling a regional endobariatric manager. These are folks that are either been hired or in some cases rehired or come back to Apollo who understand all of the different components that will be required to really have a successful practice kind of from a patient standpoint before the procedure during the procedure and after the procedure and can really help support and develop those efforts. For now it's very much focused on ORBERA because it's on label for us and they can kind of focus on those efforts while getting to know the practice is involved. And right now as Jeff mentioned at the end of the quarter we have two of those roles very much was a pilot phase to make sure it's delivering the way we think it can. And then assuming it does and as we move forward with the indication that's an area that we would plan to enhance and grow. So you have not a splitting of the sales force but kind of a layering of different capabilities.Well listen thank you all very much for joining us today. We appreciate your time and your support. On this slide we have upcoming activities and you're welcome to join of them. And then otherwise we really appreciate your time today. Thank you very much.,0.002855241,0.003105998,0.000184626
93,93,PGR,Griffith:,The severity view? I think we're just looking to see if we can -- the severity will be what it'll be in terms of what's happening from an inflationary perspective so we're just pricing to that and when we believe we can make our calendar year and lifetime target mark -- as the profit margins will start to grow.Thank you David.Not really. We see the same sort of bottlenecks in supply chain with kits that happened before what's happening in Russia and the Ukraine and so there's still some supply issues there especially with new cars and that has of course increased used car prices but that was prior to this.That's also state-by-state as well because if you got west there's issues in terms of fires etc. So I think we look at each day look at proclivity to have a major weather events. Understand our segmentation more deeply. And then we will look around. It's a competition on both direct and agency side so we've got not just the agency side where we sell Progressive home against some of the captives or bigger players. But we also have the Direct side where we have the opportunity to have Progressive Home as well as many unaffiliated partners. And so we have some advantage to get Robinsons they're not always on our paper as well. But we look across the country try to get -- we're trying to get to the more non-volatile states. We believe when we look at our results against the industry and non-weather in those states we're very competitive.I think our seasonality has been relatively stable as it has been in the past. I'm not saying we're winning Tracy. What we're saying is that we believe we got out in front of our competitors with rate from the data that we look at. We're watching trends very closely. A lot of caveats to that. And all we're saying is that with the rate we have from last year and the rate that we have on the street. We believe we're well-positioned. Again lots of caveats on making sure that we have enough and that we can grow in turn on that local media. So and maybe in a quarter or two we can have a different conversation helpful but right now we're still tentative but we wanted to just give some color on the fact that we're really proud of our rate-making machine and that we're able to get out in front of that despite a lot of headwinds.We look at the data and we look at perspective rates in terms of what we're seeing in trends. And if we need more even states where we have already increased rates several times we will share the actuarial data to get the right rate to get to our profit target margin. And that's how we've always worked. And I think regulators are thinking about their constituents because of all the other inflationary pressures. But this industry has been very clear. It needs rate -- has needed rate for some time since last year. And now we feel good that we're starting to get it in many of our larger states. So I'm just optimistic because we were able to have great conversations great relationships in a couple of key states and many states across the board with key regulators where they get it. They see the data. They understand it and they know the worst thing you can do is not give the rate because then you're not going to have insurance available for their constituents and ultimately you're going to have to get the rate. So it's going to be over time there will be bigger rates in the future. So I think that's how it works. And so I am very optimistic.No. We have a very specific goal of not subsidizing and to have every one of our products in aggregate common to our 96 combined ratio goal.The 28% is in-force. It's no -- new. I'm sorry new. 40% new in direct 10% new in agency yeah. Are we going to report [Indiscernible] I'm sorry?I think we are saying we don't share that.Thanks. Tracy.Well Brian if I knew the answer to that -- we're -- all I can say is we're working --Yeah we're working with the regulators and doing all that we can because we want to be able to open up and we want to be able to have affordable available insurance for California and just -- most populous state we'd love to grow there and we'll do what we can to do so.Yeah. We're taking very significant non-rate actions because of the inability to get the rate. And obviously we will work with the regulators to figure out the best thing to do for our mutual constituents and we just need to continue to do so.It really does reflect the pricing environment. And I talked a little bit about the difference in agency and direct with agency being a little bit more elastic. And when we look at PLEs Texas and Florida they obviously don't drop as dramatically which would tell you it's pricing because we got out in those two big states pretty early. I think that our holy grail is retention but we also have to be priced right. And we also noticed some consumers are trying to figure out can they change their coverages or do things differently or as Snapshot and things like that to reduce their prices. So I know in our CRM organization we continue to try to grow what we call our customer preservation teams. So if they call in and they are challenged to pay their bill because of increases. Can we work with them on bill plans on coverage to make sure they are obviously still covered but to get them the right rate in order for them to stay? But it is it is reflective on the majority with prices.Thanks [Indiscernible]Probably point to average written premium growth with the pricing increases coming in. And I think that's reflective of our new business growth in overall growth.Yeah. I would direct you back to our four strategic pillars that we talk about all the time we make sure we invest in all the time and I have seen our strength there. So the first one is our people and our culture are our most important competitive advantage. So during the pandemic we have really made sure that we are connecting even if it's the virtual to our employees like continue to do every new hire class. I am out and about virtually and now more in-person but people and culture are really important. And it's important for people to feel good about being on a winning team. The second we've talked about a lot is our brands. So we're going to continue to invest in our brands and have some really great creative coming out end of this month or early June. And then of course competitive prices we've been talking about that for the last hour we want to get to where we're really competitive. Some part of that is getting the right rates. But it's also that continuation of our superior segmentation and making sure that we care deeply about expenses. So we continue to create expense goals for the future. And then lastly and John have brought this up is our broad coverage so we're going to continue to be where when and how customers want to shop. And I think that's the key. So regardless of the people entered independent agency channel or the direct channel we've been in both for a long time we appreciate both. We appreciate the fact that consumers have a choice that if they want to buy on their phone their iPad through an agent through 1-800 Progressive and we're going to be there as they change especially if we've invested more in business closed floor on the commercial side of HomeQuote Explorer. So all those four strategic pillars really worked hand and glove to make sure that we stay competitive. I feel really great about our position in both channels and how we think about the future.Thank you.Yeah we'll look at timing of when to start when you ramp up some local advertising. Remember we haven't shut off our national advertising so it's not like our brand isn't out there so we still have some ability to grow. But yeah we'll look at the pivotal time or right time of when we should start that growth making sure that the rates in each particular state are adequate for us to reach our target profit margins.I don't understand you.Yeah. Not really sure if we know that. But I think what John was saying too in terms of elasticity our renewals are improving on the elasticity side which tells us that and we do histogram on decreases or increases to a certain percentage or buckets of percentages. And we're seeing more people even if they are shopping they're staying when they get their renewal which likely means they can't find a better rate. That's the only thing we can look at. What's in data but it's hard to say with all of the economics is going on in the country.Thank you Meyer.Yeah. I mean I think our standard and our operating policy hasn't changed. And remember for reporting and 94.5% we're still looking at perspective rates and we're looking at trends that will be future over 96% if we don't do some. So the data is in a moment in time we're looking at rate need ahead of time to make sure that we put that good business on the books for both a calendar year '96 and a lifetime '96 I think those constraints as you call them I mean I think I'd call them just our operating plans have worked well over the years. And in fact the first time we talked about '96 was in our annual report 1971 and when we went public. And it's worked really well for us. If you look at our long-term trend it's nice to have that Governor it helps keep us disciplined around our pricing helps keep us disciplined around our expense philosophy. And it has built us to the number three and our Personal Auto carrier. And I can tell you when I started in 1988 we were nowhere there so we will continue with that of course '96 is in the aggregate so it doesn't mean that obviously our new business on the direct side wouldn't come in at a '96 and there's other areas where we aggregate are up to the 96. And I think it's been a great winning business model.Well I think it depends on if you're looking at the trailing three or trailing 12. I think trailing three as more responsive to our rate increases. And so like I'd started to say before we saw early results with our retention in some of the states where we took increases more quickly. When could still seeing a little bit of degradation again a lot of that is relative to what our competition is doing. So if you're getting your renewal and you're stopping and rates are going up. And again that's why we tried to get ahead of rate. Because if we can be stable which is what consumers want and they go to shop and now it's much more increased with our competitors they're going to stay with us then of course the new business we've been talking about for a while. So we keep a close eye on retention especially because we've been really proud of the work we've done today over the many many years. But we'll watch that closely and do everything in our power to keep our customers that we've taken so much to acquire.Thank you.,0.002995312,0.003371298,0.000339246
94,94,ITW,Mitchell:,Thanks Michael. And then switching to the balance sheet which I don't think has been touched on yet and maybe some customer element as well. But your inventories are up I think almost sort of 50% year-on-year and up 10%-plus sequentially in Q1. Just kind of trying to understand when do you think that starts to level out? And this major sort of inventory build that you're seeing how assure you that you're not seeing the same phenomenon across your customers and channel partners as well with obviously some risk to that if we do see final demand slowdown?That's perfect. Thank you.,0.002536416,0.002536416,0
95,95,BDX,Polen:,Vijay this is Tom. Thanks for the good question. So on flu COVID combo testing is very much in line with our expectations. The -- as you said it was $70 million to $80 million or so is what we expected for the full year and you would expect a portion of that to be in Q1 and it played out as such. Essentially it's relatively immaterial to overall BD as you can imagine if you take the 75 80 and you spread it over a couple of quarters. So that's what was in our numbers. We have not seen any -- it's a normal to light flu season this year. It's certainly higher than it was last year when there was essentially no flu. But if you look at the CDC data it is on track for a light to normal flu season. but nothing above our expectations at this point in time. I'll turn it over to Chris for the other question.And Robbie this is Tom. I think you've heard me used the word prudent pretty nonstop since the COVID pandemic hit. And so I would view our guide today is prudent with -- as the market continues to remain more stable that there's opportunity for upside as we move through the year.Matthew this is Tom. I'll turn that over to Simon.I think just to add Simon those strategic product exits that we've been doing in PI but also in other areas of the company as part of our ReCoDe initiative across the board those -- with the strength of our revenue we've been in a position to accelerate that strategy in a number of ways. And those products that we're discontinuing typically always have growth rates that are far below the company average and margins that are far below the company average. And so it's addition by subtraction as we think about that long term as we simplify our portfolio and focus in those higher-growth spaces that are going to be driving the future of the company. So thank you Matthew for the question.No Matthew. That's very -- that's exactly what we said when we gave guidance. That's no change at all. We continue to be focused on advancing Alaris and there's no updates.Okay. Thank you for the question Larry. Why don't we start with the last question first. I'll turn it to Chris on the growth pretty clear answer.And on pricing Larry so as you know as you know BD very very well we've been focused on pricing for many years and had begun the journey with putting in resources in every business that are dedicated to pricing pricing leadership at the company level as well. And obviously in an environment where there's record levels of inflation it's been an area that has been ever more important. And so we began our journey of working on pricing in an inflationary environment last year and began taking actions. And you're starting to see and will continue to see the impacts of that flow through in the year. We take those actions very serious in discussions with our customers. We understand they work in a reimbursement-constrained environment. And so if you look at where we are implementing price most significantly it is -- and we're very transparent with our customers by the way on where we're raising price and why we're raising price and the impacts of inflation as the driver of that. But where you see it most is in those products that we're selling for a dime a quarter or low dollars where BD over decades has invested billions of dollars of capital in creating extremely efficient fully automated manufacturing facilities that allow us to be one of the only companies on the planet who can sell billions of devices at dimes and quarters and dollars. And because of the way that we've just continued to refine our manufacturing capabilities over the year in a best-in-class ways any increases in variable costs like resins as an example or chips et cetera they tend to flow right through and directly impact product margins and profitability. And so we can share what those impacts are on those raw material increases with our customers and we have those discussions and we've been raising price actively particularly in those product categories. And so while we're not giving out -- not sharing a specific number on price through the year we are -- have been very very active on that. And it's -- we're doing it in every region around the world it's not a U.S. or Europe thing it's equal across all geographies and directly related to passing through a portion of the inflationary impacts that we're getting on raw materials. Of course at the same time we're taking a number of actions beyond pricing passing it all through to our customers and that includes us taking cost actions within the company continuing to drive significant continuous improvement in our manufacturing plants and always look at ways to be more efficient and look at prices that last resort. But we have certainly been doing more price this year than we have seen historically.Thank you for the question Matt. So on the supply chain and inflation perspective we don't have -- there's not assumptions that there's any major material reversal of the cost. There are some areas where we expect continued trending. Resins for example have been heading in a moderately to minorly favorable direction as an example. We expect that to continue. But overall we don't see major abatements in areas like shipping as an example or chips. That's -- we bake that into our outlook as we go forward. We do think those supply chain dynamics will continue certainly longer than most of the world thought at this time last year and we see them -- many of them continuing through '22. So we have that built into our considerations and outlook. The other question was.Yes. Thanks Matt. Certainly we do look at those and we have raised price in a number of areas as appropriate across the portfolio. There are a few products of course in today's environment that aren't impacted by inflation in areas such as shipping or computer chips et cetera. Instrumentation will be a good example of electromechanical inflation that we see and we raised costs there in areas such as service where spare parts certainly the cost of those go up. And we do share the increases of those as well. So the answer is yes. But by far and away the most significant increases would be on those products that we are just extremely efficient at producing and where the percentage of COGS made up of raw materials are disproportionately high.And Matt just maybe one other item to add is we have been very active and we put this in place last year. We have a formal inflation task force that we've established with multiple different pillars within that and dedicated groups working on everything from rethinking our logistics chain and that includes looking at alternative shipping partners in a number of areas. For example how can you ship from Asia to the U.S. or from Europe U.S. to Europe in more efficient ways? What parts of our supply chain have traditionally used airfreight as an example that we can move on to rail or boats? We've been taking actions and rethinking that both how we get products to customers but also from raw material suppliers into our plants. And of course looking at the materials themselves where there's alternative vendors and working with existing vendors on different technologies that could be more cost effective for us to use. All of those are different components within our inflation task force it's been very active and we're seeing the impacts of that as well.Thank you Rick for the question. And hopefully get to see you again soon in person. As the pandemic here it's been a while since we were able to connect live which I always enjoy. So I appreciate it. It's a great great question. Certainly as we look back and we laid out the BD2025 strategy I do see that we're beginning to transition from how we view the first phase of that strategy into the second. The first phase of that strategy and I remember our discussion well we talked about an initial focus on including strengthening our balance sheet and cash flows to increase flexibility. And you've seen really pleased with the team's work around accounts receivable payables inventory. You've seen our free cash flow conversion moved up meaningfully. over that period of time. And that's allowed us to have flexibility to do what you just mentioned M&A opportunities. And I think we are among if not the highest number of acquisitions within med tech this -- over the past 2 years. We clearly demonstrated our interest there. We've also spent a lot of time accelerating innovation and reshaping our portfolio and driving strong execution in that portfolio. If you recall very early on we jump-started that with the Growth and Innovation Fund. We gave that strategy a further boost by reinvesting a portion of the COVID testing proceeds last year. And we're beginning to see the results of that work. And the energy across the organization as our mindset is very strongly pivoted to growth. And I am pleased with the cadence of the company M&A and how we've built those capabilities as a new lever for the organization. Obviously just this quarter and the first few weeks of Q2 we've done 4 acquisitions. This year I believe we did 6 or 7. Last year up to 17 over the last 2 years since we've met. And we are going to continue that focus. We shared at our Analyst Day that 80% of our M&A has been focused in transformative solutions. The 3 areas that we've described repeatedly smart connected care enabling new care settings and improving outcomes in chronic disease focused within higher-growth sectors within those markets. Expect our tuck-in M&A strategy to continue to be focused within those while selectively doing deals that help secure and strengthen our position within our durable core which is also doing very well as evidenced through our performance this quarter. On the -- as we think about M&A opportunities we certainly have -- continue to have a strong pipeline going forward. We've made commentary we continue to not have any transformational M&A within scope of our strategy at this time. We're focused on tuck-in M&A. We do have the ability to go larger than what we've been doing more in the up to $2 billion. And we can -- we will flex over $2 billion for the right strategic opportunities and value-creating opportunities. And so we'll continue to evolve the size of those as we go forward. On the -- as we think about -- and maybe one last thing there too when we talk about M&A items coming in of course a major milestone here this week with the Board approving the spin of embecta and that's part of our portfolio strategy as we now have dedicated Diabetes Care business. We will be one of the largest dedicated diabetes companies on the planet able to have a focused management team with focused cash flows driving a focused strategy in that space to create shareholder value while we focus in the other remaining areas for BD. Focus our talent our resources our capabilities in those areas that are most strategic to us. And I think it's a value-creating opportunity very clearly for what will be now 2 stand-alone companies. But a major milestone. And interestingly a milestone that was achieved nearly to the day 100 years. It was January of 1922 end of January 1922 when the first insulin was injected. It was used in therapy on a teenager up in Canada. And it's interesting nearly 100 years later is when we just are spinning out the world's largest insulin injection company now as a stand-alone organization. So on the Simplify side we're really pleased with the progress there. And you could hear from whether or not the actions that we've been taking and how we've been exiting certain product lines that thousands of SKUs that we're getting rid of as we simplify our portfolio to focus on those products that matter and we're going to drive our growth and help simplify our plans. We have dedicated teams working on our network simplification strategy. Those have all been identified and are underway around our manufacturing footprint. And while SKU rationalization you've heard it's well underway. We'll continue to execute that. Largely over the next year that will be completed as that. At the same time you can see very clearly we are hyper focused on our margin strategy. ReCoDe is part of that but it also includes areas around the supply chain and inflation management that I talked about includes pricing as part of that as well. We made a commitment during our Analyst Day around the 400 basis points of improvements in getting back to pre-'19 margin levels by 2024 and we've got that in our sights and are hyper-focused on delivering to that goal. So we're very pleased with the progress we're making. As we look ahead we're going to continue to focus on executing that strategy that we outlined as part of BD2025 and shared more details on at our Analyst Day and we look forward to continue to update you on the progress.Okay. Thank you and thanks everyone for your questions. Before we sign off I just want to thank BD's 75 000 associates around the globe who live our purpose every day to advance the world of health who are working tirelessly to support our customers and frontline health care workers around the world and are committed to executing our strategy. I'm proud of how we've started fiscal '22. I'm looking forward to continuing to deliver on our goals and making meaningful impacts for our customers and their patients around the world. On behalf of the entire executive team thank you for your efforts and sacrifices. And operator with that we will end today's call.,0.00403592,0.010477841,0.002883618
96,96,MU,Mehrotra:,So I think you're right to note that certainly supply is limited. As I highlighted earlier CapEx in the industry has been disciplined. And of course as you know that exiting 2020 there was inventory in the industry. Supplier inventories are at lean levels as well. And of course in terms of supply growth given the various aspects of supply chain shortages across all industries that have been discussed equipment today has long lead time as well. So overall when you really look at calendar year '22 overall supply is rather limited. And of course demand trends are strong. What I would like to highlight is that you really have to look at long-term CAGR. The long-term CAGR on DRAM of mid-teens to high teens is really driving strong growth and it is there because of all of the demand trends we have discussed. And so you can't just look at one year you have to continue to look at longer-term trends. These are secular trends in nature driving more demand for memory and storage. And of course what we have provided here is our estimation regarding the bit growth this is what we expect and we'll continue to monitor this. Essentially we expect a healthy industry demand supply environment in calendar year '22 particularly on the side of DRAM.And I think again it's my supply comments are based on some of the CapEx that we have ourselves said is in DRAM is guided down but also by our other suppliers in other suppliers that have DRAM in the industry.As we highlighted I mean our discussions with our customers and LTAs are more around the requirements of supply. And of course these lead to closer discussion in terms of understanding their product portfolio their road map and how our road map gets defined and how our portfolio fits in with their requirements. So as I mentioned earlier I mean these discussions these relationships with our customers have continued to evolve over the course of last few years taking us from yes that 10% LTAs to now 75% LTAs. But they're also continuing to evolve in terms of the relationship that is based on value as well. So of course we will continue to look for opportunities as I mentioned earlier to strengthen these LTAs in the future as well. And I would just like to highlight that we are in this good position with the customers in terms of gaining greater visibility to their requirements and being able to drive these LTAs through a lot of good work that our team has done here. The sales teams our business unit teams and of course supported by strong technology product portfolio and supply chain execution that just gives these customers and other partners the confidence in engaging in these LTA discussions with us.So with respect to 2022 as the new processors that are able to use DDR5 gets rolled out into the marketplace that will drive adoption of DDR5 in the server space as well. As we noted in the PC space DDR5 adoption has already started and we have begun to shape the DDR5 product. DDR5 currently is in high demand. Actually supply there is limited for DDR5 in the industry. So when I look at PC as well as for server we expect that DDR5 will be ramping up first in PC. And as the processors with DDR5 new processors become available in the industry. We particularly see that ramping up later in calendar year '22. I expect that we will be exiting calendar year '22 with approximately 20% the mix of DDR -- I'm sorry with approximately 20% of the mix of DRAM in compute space at approximately 20% there okay?And so a stronger ramp in the second half versus the first half because again as those new processors ramp up into production with our customers that will drive a ramp of DDR5 in the second half in the server space. And in PC as I mentioned it's happening well throughout calendar year '22.So inventory strategy is clearly vary from customers to customers. And some definitely given what pandemic introduced in terms of supply chain shortages are looking at strategically higher level of inventory. Some may also be doing it for geopolitical considerations. So we don't really yet see customers going back to pre-pandemic levels but the strategy around inventory does vary from customer to customer. And overall as I said for -- on an industry-wide level while there may be some pockets of some customers carrying extra inventory overall given the current environment customer inventory levels are in a decent shape. And just look at us Micron itself is also in our own manufacturing we are holding a lot more inventory of raw materials just to make sure that our supply chain has assuredness with respect to our ability to supply our customers. And our operations planning just in the current environment of somewhat higher uncertainty on the geopolitical front as well as pandemic-related front is operating with greater levels of inventory -- with non-memory components inventory. And similarly customers have similar approach as well in terms of managing their inventory.So our procurement team and our supply chain team works closely with equipment suppliers in terms of long-term planning and securing of slots for equipment. And we continue to drive that. And yes we have of course seen lengthening lead times but those have also been factored in in terms of our overall planning. And as I mentioned I mean we are really seeing a lot more collaboration with these suppliers in terms of driving our own demand -- timing of equipment. So no I would not say that we have seen any push outs versus our own expectations. But again those expectations of equipment delivery are built based on our collaboration with the suppliers and with the visibility that we have provided and with a lot of good planning work between us and our suppliers. And your second part of your question I forgot now what was the second part of the question? Can you please repeat that?So the earthquake in Taiwan at the time of the earthquake certainly did reduce some of our bid production. By end of the quarter our impact to our overall output was meaningfully reduced.The auto and industrial certainly will be high-growth drivers for us across the cycle. I spoke to all the demand drivers in the automotive market. Micron is clearly an automotive leader in this space. And we said that auto and industrial combined over 10%. If you look at automotive itself our share of the market is somewhere mid-single digits. And this year we would expect to continue to grow based on all our experience in this market our share leadership the high quality we provide and increasing demand for memory and storage content in these markets. And of course industrial is also growing for us with 5G enabling tremendous demand in the industrial segment with industrial IoT market drones with surveillance equipment with automation in the factories. All of this is tending to drive greater demand as well. So we expect solid growth in both of these markets. We expect the -- overall if you look at DRAM content CAGR in the automotive market that's approximately 40% over the course of next three years NAND CAGR in the automotive power kit above 50% as well over the course of next three years. So this really has legs in terms of sustainable growth. And again we are well positioned in these markets and we expect our percentage of revenue in this market to continue to increase over the course of next several years.So first of all with respect to our focus on the business with respect to our people and Micron has been proactive all throughout the pandemic in taking actions to protect the safety of our team members whether it is managing strict protocols with our operations -- on-site operations with respect to masking physical distancing as well as vaccination. And of course as a result of that we have been successful in continuing to run our operations all throughout the pandemic. And despite various industry-wide challenges on supply we have been overall generally quite good in terms of our ability to support our customers. With respect to the Micron of course we will continue our stringent focus on safety of our team members as well as continuing to run our operations. We will not let our guard down in this regard and of course continue to monitor all the trends and developments here. I would like to point out that even with Delta all our operations continued to run well. And of course as you saw the demand for our products continued to be strong as well. And of course we saw in some parts of the business higher demand as a result of COVID for certain periods of time whereas other parts may have had lower demand for certain periods of time as well. So of course we will continue to monitor the trend. And to the extent that Omicron has any impact on the macroeconomic environment of course that might impact some of our business. However you have seen that we have been extremely adaptive. We have been extremely agile and we will continue to do so.,0.002995476,0.003275335,0.000210555
97,97,PANW,Arora:,"I have the pleasure having Mr. Lee Klarich our Chief Product Officer and I don't want him to feel like he doesn't need to answer anything on these calls so I'm going to ask him to jump in here Phil. But the only 2 cents I'll give you is that whenever the customer has been partly through their journey and their decided their homegrown tools or their point solutions are not the right solution for their infrastructure it's typically where we see large Prisma Cloud engagements. Having said that I'm not saying that they don't use us for those individual use cases -- They do. But eventually the step-up and say I need to make a comprehensive confidence product bed. But I'm going have Lee jump in and talk about some of the shift left stuff we're seeing -- with the Bridgecrew a recent announcement yesterday of offering wiz - like capabilities which is 18-plus scanning. As well as integrating our Shift Left Enable [Indiscernible] Prisma collateral enterprise platform so there's consistency.Yeah of course. I think a few quarters ago my colleague Mr. Lee Klarich had done a phenomenal job of highlighting that the Prisma SASE customer is more valuable to us from an LTV perspective i.e. on a like-for-like basis. And also it is a lower TCO opportunity for the customer because now you're not upgrading every one of your hardware boxes. Take a case you have 1400 stores somewhere you got to put a hardware box everywhere and you got to upgrade them for every new software release we offer and that's a truck roll and requires you to be comfortable that you want to do it. In the case of Prisma SASE we'd roll it out so all of our 1400 customers boom in 2 weeks we have them upgraded to the next version of software which allows us to do multiple software releases in quarters. And in the case of our firewalls it takes 1 year to write the next big major release and it takes 4 months before our customers will be -- will tend to be agree to go and deploy it across their 40 000 stores because they're not they're not comfortable yet because it's going to be a big change. And if that chain doesn't work. So I think technically conceptually 5 years from now we're looking back saying what a stupid idea to go roll trucks and upgrade hardware #NAME? but a friend of mine is very much into electric cars and he bought a new electric car. I have 1 too. Mine is a Tesla. It does over-the-year software updates. His he has to drive to the dealership and wait in line then they put a USB stick and they'll upgrade it. You tell me which one you want. So I think in the long term we're going to say SASE is like a Tesla to the -- drive the car to the dealership and stick a USB in it. So from my perspective SASE is a better technical outcome. It's a better security outcome for the customers It's a better value for us and it's a better value for the customer in the long term.Please give me shit Brian. Because it's his car I forgot.Yeah. Look as Dipak highlighted from a product revenue and product cost perspective I guess translation -- Some of our chip suppliers are asking for more money for the scarce chips that they offer us. That's what it is. So in the short term there is no offset. You want to chip you pay for it you buy it. In the broader scheme at Palo Alto we can offset it with other cost containment strategies with Dipak's on top of -- in dealing with them. Maybe you could talk about some of the supply chain efforts your team is doing because -- I will tell you -- it's kind of funny. It's as we said this is one of our highest product growth quarters in recent history in the midst of a supply-chain crisis. And you guys know we can't book it until you ship it. So we've not only been able to book it but ship it. So Dipak's team must be doing something.And our shift to software helps.Clay? Did we lose Clay?Got it. I think I think.Great. Thanks for question. You know what having BJ here has been amazing. We can actually now have -- Amit is in a room elsewhere during a CIO meeting BJ 's in Europe meaning customers and I'm here doing an earnings call. So we've been able to divide and conquer in terms of being able to touch more and more customers. Outside of your question on Cortex and [Indiscernible] Look we've been on a journey. We caught this Cloud thing early in our mind. But we're getting our motion right figuring it out and now we started to enable channel partners. As we enabled channel partners we have been able to amplify our ability to go and approach our customers with Cloud capabilities. So as you can imagine this is still a nascent market in terms of it's -- I think this is going to be a huge market in next 5 7 years. No wonder you're seeing those lofty valuation of startups out there. I firmly believe we are 18 to 24 months ahead from a comprehensive platform perspective. We're not standing quietly. I still -- we still have more engineers of Palo Alto building Cloud security capability than all the other startups roughly combined. So we're not worried about our strength and our ability. We have to remain nimble we have to remain agile and we have to make sure we amplify our go-to-market capabilities. So from that perspective yes you will see us continuing to amplify our Cloud go-to-market capabilities and our Cortex go-to-market capabilities. We are working on some very exciting product enhancements in our XDR front and Cortex front. More to come in future calls but that gives us confidence that as we keep seeding the market with XDR is going to open up a very large TAM thereafter for us in future quarters for future years for the Company allowing us to strengthen that third pillar. And last but not the least I will give you one more anecdote Adam. In the last 90 days I have met more CIOs personally than I met on the first three years of working at Palo Alto. And that's not because I was lazy first it's because I have had the opportunity to go engage with them because now we have a comprehensive cybersecurity platform and many of them are saying """"This point solutions stuff is not working. I'm moving to the Cloud. So now I have some sort of redundancy built into my DevOps environment. Therefore I may be willing to go look at one vendor to help me in in the entire stack from one end to the other. """" So that's the go-to-market update.Thank you for that question. Look I think as we talked about probably at the end of last quarter new administration early days they were still trying to put their authorized process to get their stuff in order. So we did see obviously because there was ample Fed business for us at the end of their fiscal quarter -- fiscal year and are in the midst of our quarter. That was strong. What is even more heartening is if you guys have time I actually did a keynote for Ginny Easterly yesterday morning for our Ignite event and it's very fascinating to hear her because you are seeing there is a very strong directive and will in the U.S. government right now to really treat cyber security seriously and you've seen that manifested in the various infrastructure bills where there are specific line items for cyber security spend to the extent there are line items for that cyber management in various bills. So you can see that there is a lot of seeding of Cybersecurity thatâ€™s going on in the federal sort of budgets. As with everything with governments is thoughtful it's -- it takes time and it happens slightly slower than analysts and CEOs expect.So Irvin we have been very clear about certain areas of the market which worked well with us through an API or connectivity - based. For example we've been clear in identity access management. We think there's ample good players out there. Us going into that space is not going to add any incremental value. Or similarly with email security we've steered clear of that space not because we believe that eventually people migrating to Google Microsoft and Proofpoints there and there's a bunch of other people. So there are some areas we've seen where -- I think the best way to think about it as we did this exercise 3 years ago. We identified a blue ocean called Cloud and then moved to the Cloud. And we said this is going to be a lot of new security products created for the Cloud. Let's get ahead of the trend early which is what we did. We were about 6 or 7 companies in that space integrated and the results are in front of you and I think we announced for you [Indiscernible] for Prisma Cloud last Q4 so you can expect that has grown this quarter which puts us as I said at 6 to 10 times on many of these startups are getting funded at $6 billion to $8 billion. So clearly that's not a price I'd like to pay for that ARR given I'm sitting on 5 to 10 times of that AR myself. So from that perspective it's both an area of the market that we want to pursue ideally a Blue Ocean which is Cloud Security or we have a disruptive technology of you believe will compel the customer to replace what they have today. And that you are seeing happen in the XDR space that used to be an endpoint space [Indiscernible] semantics which is being structurally replaced by CrowdStrike [Indiscernible] Carbon Black and the others. So those are the areas where I pay attention to. A third one is where our firewall teams are able to go upsell and attach that capability to the firewall. For example yesterday we launched next-generation CASB. I think that is a transformative product. I think it will replace majority of the CASB out there. You will not need to buy CASB separately from any other vendor. Again 3 years ago we had a long gaps and we were doing a lot of acquisitions. We've gotten to a point where it's almost in 8 9 times out of 10 is better for us to build because we have 60% 50% 70% of the sensors the capabilities we just have to build the other 30%. In net new areas that's the question and so far we haven't found any compelling area which makes us jump out of bed yearning go look at it. Having said that Walter me Lee we still see 5 to 20 companies every quarter in seriousness not to acquire but to understand what they're doing and if that is meaningful to the industry I would keep track of it.Michael I want to leave you with historical perspective. Three years ago we were not in these businesses; 18 months ago is when we launched many of these products. So today am I delighted with where we are? A 100%. Are we ahead of my expectations? For sure. Do I high expectations going forward? Yes. Have we cleaned out some of the stuff? That's my job. Every day every week we clean out stuff in our processes to make sure our go-to-market capabilities our product capabilities get better and better. As to the specific issues we were dealing with in Prisma Cloud and Cortex we've hired some new people they are doing a phenomenal job. This past quarter we expect them to continue that job. Based on the visibility we have on Prisma Cloud front similarly in the Cortex front we're in a highly competitive market yet we continue to deliver on our expectation and exceed them. Like I said XDR is strategic in the context that I believe overtime there will be a convergence between what we do in XDR XSOAR and our teams are working hard towards making that happen. Also I would [Indiscernible] that we do in Expanse so we think we have critical mass in that Cortex space to really really continue to build product capability over time bring them to build that into a very large business. Similarly on Prisma Cloud again I think you can see from all the valuations people are getting or not. If it's not value then we'd say it's a validation that everybody has identified that as a big area. And I honestly believe that I'm not just saying I believe that our teams have worked hard towards building an early lead and our job is to keep sustain that lead strengthen our product continually and make sure that capabilities are made apparent to our customers.Jonathan that was interesting and thank you for asking the question. As I mentioned I've been able to meet a lot more CIOs the last 90 days than I've had in my 3 years here. And I'll tell you every conversation with CIO is a conversation of adapting their information security and IT stack to the new reality in the market. The new reality is majority of companies are not expecting everybody to come back to the office. They're all looking for architectures which can make everything consistent. The most number of cyber attacks we've seen in the last year and a half or so have been in remote working and VPN because people have had to deploy their older VPN technology and make it be functional from every corner of the world. So people are seeing that is the new threat factor. They are thinking about how do I take this and make this a long term sustainable network architecture? Couple that with their Cloud transformation it's funny. Three years ago when I'd asked them the question they were predict -- dipping their toes in the cloud today all of them are in two or three clouds. So there is a very strong secular trend behind the SASE opportunity as well as the Cloud opportunity. You pick your favorite sport analogy I think we're in the first innings of baseball and we've bowled the second over in cricket.It's alright. I don't understand the first one either. So it's all good.Thank you everybody for joining. And I just want to reiterate in my 3.5 years of being here I haven't felt more bullish in the business as I feel today given the visibility into the pipeline and the results are being -- teams have been able to deliver in Q4 as well as the visibility we have going into our three-year plan off for the first quarter. I want to thank you for attending. I want to thank you -- I look forward to seeing you in upcoming investor events as well as I want to thank all of our customers our partners and most of all our employees around the world for putting in the hard work to get us where we are. For that see you next time.""",0.006111554,0.021240532,0.006246398
98,98,EQIX,Meyers:,Thanks Jon.Yes a little bit. I would say overall look the big power issue is really Singapore. It's very much on the margin in any other places. I think going forward I think we might see more of -- we have the planning to do in 2023 and beyond as power -- as hedges roll off and as we think about that as I commented earlier but I think that's more of something we have plenty of visibility to and an ability to respond to. As it relates to this year Singapore is by far the overwhelming issue. And there's not a ton of change from what we said last quarter. I think Q1 was actually a little better than we expected. And then the back half of the year might be a little higher than we had originally forecasted but they're kind of going to come out kind of in roughly the same place. We now have over 50% of our load hedged or locked in rate-wise in Singapore. So we have better visibility of that. And I don't think a ton of variability and outcome from here. We'll continue to update you if that changes. But not a big change probably slightly more on the back end and less in this -- we had a better quarter this quarter than what we had in that original forecast. But on a full year basis really roughly what we had said previously.Yes a good question. Good question. I think that we have a fair amount of headroom in a lot of markets in the Americas right? We're at a lower overall utilization rate there on a much bigger business. So there's plenty of capacity to sell. So I'm sure my sales teams are hearing me say that. So they're playing to go around. And the Americas business has performed exceptionally well. And another shout-out to Arquelle Shaw our senior sales leader in the Americas. And I think that business is really humming and delivering strong sales execution. And so you're right. A lot of the investment is going to -- going outside the US but we've also are topping up in key markets in the US and in the Americas broadly to meet the demand there. So we feel good about our ability to both deliver the new capacity and to sell it. And we've got a new President of the Americas coming online Tara Risser and she's a tremendously customer-centric executive. And very excited about that. So I feel -- we feel great about the trajectory in the Americas. Again I think plenty of opportunity to grow into the capacity that is there and drive utilization up. And we will continue to invest where there are markets that we start to see sort of pinch points out there in the future. And so overall I feel really good about our ability to continue to put capacity online and sell it aggressively.Yes. I mean I think you're getting that sort of enterprise LFP and whether or not there is a sort of intermediate offer there between xScale. I would tell you that we again continue to -- if those needs are in the context of a broader platform requirement and how a customer is thinking about their digital transformation then we will talk to them about how we might do that and where we might be able to meet that need. But again the sort of the larger footprint more commodity sort of colo enterprise requirement isn't a major focus for us. In fact as I talked about we've really been retooling our revenue mix in markets like Europe to really focus on the sweet spot of the retail business interconnection-edge ecosystem-centric that delivers superior MRR per cab. It delivers superior retention. And that's what you're seeing show up in the business better MRR per cab lower churn et cetera. So we've got to stick to the strategy that continues to drive the performance in the business. And I would tell you what we're seeing. You saw -- on occasion you do see large enterprise-type needs. And we'll partner with enterprises and thinking that through. But I will tell you that for the most part I think a lot of times customers are saying 'Hey we're going to put -- we're going to use a mix of public cloud and private cloud and we really need to place our data in a sort of -- in more of an inter-cloud kind of location to drive performance and to meet statutory requirements et cetera. And so I feel really good about the portfolio that we have. And I actually think the real -- a big opportunity with us on the enterprise side is the digital services portfolio. Really delivering them Metal -- they're finding very well Metal is a value proposition because it helps them mitigate their technology life cycle management. It helps them be more agile more scale more rapidly move capacity around as they need it and as customer demand mandates that for them. And then Network Edge is a way that they really are thinking about retooling and rethinking networking in a cloud-centric world. And then of course Fabric you see the momentum that we have there. And so I feel good about the portfolio and we're going to -- we stood up the digital services BU and are going to continue to make some investments there and I think that's going to position us really well for continued enterprise momentum. So really long answer to your question but I think we'd be very selective about that. We don't see a big priority on sort of large footprint lower margin profile kind of business.Well I mean it's -- I think the business is executing really well. We're not sort of trying to chase every bit of hyperscale that's out there. We've got an aggressive but an appropriate plan that we think delivers strategic value to the overall platform. We're focused on a relatively small number of sort of global hyperscalers that we think are critical to how the overall cloud macro plays out and are focused on them. I think it's really just being able to continue to deliver capacity. And so we've been more aggressive about land banking. We're continuing to work to make sure that we have the capacity and the key equipment necessary. So our supply chain team has been active both in terms of both our -- the xScale side of our business and retail to ensure that we are buying inventory or making forward commitments to ensure the availability of equipment to get projects delivered on time. So I think that's going to be the key thing for us. And right now we feel very good about that. In fact since the last quarter we talked about -- over a couple of quarters ago I guess it was we talked about having roughly $100 million of pre-commitment and inventory in place to try to mitigate against supply chain we've nearly doubled that to continue to sort of anticipate and head off any pinch points that exist in the supply chain. So I think we're doing a good job there but I think that's the area that we need to continue to focus on. And I guess the proof is in the pudding in that our delivery dates are all on average a few outliers here and there but on average we're no more than a week or two delayed on projects. And so being continuing to deliver on-time deployments.Yes. Look I mean we -- every deal is a little bit different. I mean I would say that there are good examples in our past of where we have stretched in what terms of maybe a multiple that we paid based on our belief about our ability to sort of buy that multiple down over time through growth. And I think Metronode and Infomart are probably a couple of examples that pop to mind that we've both turned out to be really great deals for us. But we're going to be appropriately disciplined. We're not going to win every deal but we also believe that M&A is a key tool in the toolbox. And we think there are opportunities out there for us to continue to extend and scale our platform and our priorities kind of remain the same. Key interconnection assets scale in markets where we're seeing success and continue to extend our platform geographically into the markets that matter. And I think all those types of opportunities are available. So -- and we've got the balance sheet to pull it off I think. So we'll be out there we'll be aggressive. And in cases where we think it makes sense to stretch we will. And where we don't we won't.Yes. Great question Brendan. One obviously that we are very focused on and think a lot about. I'll start with just simply saying that we continue to see 50% as an appropriate long-term target for EBITDA margin. There's a number of moving parts on the overall margin trajectory of the business. And as you said some -- we've talked about many of those with power particularly the Singapore power situation being central to that. We kind of already talked about that dynamic which is -- were a little better than expected in Q1. Back half of the year might be a little bit worse than what we had originally forecast but not a major shift there. As we enter next year we'd expect to see APAC margins normalize either through moderating rates and we can't really predict that fully. Or even if they don't moderate by us essentially putting additional PIs through and getting in line with the broader market. And so I think we'll see margin normalization there. And we continue to drive and expect continued operating leverage in the business in the back half of the year from several of our targeted efficiency programs in the business. And so we do think we need to have other levers available to continue to drive operating leverage. But we also may make some investments in quarter ahead I think given the tremendous booking strengths that we're seeing. So I don't think that would be surprising to anybody. So bottom line we'll give you more detailed guidance on the 2023 and beyond margin profile as that becomes more clear. But I think the really critical takeaways are that: one we continue to see 50% as an achievable target; and two that we really remain confident that we can deliver against the Analyst Day AFFO per share growth targets through some combination of top line growth and appropriate operating leverage. And at the end of the day that's really our lighthouse metric is driving that AFFO per share growth.Yeah. Really good question. Generally we don't see that happening. I think a number of the â€“ I think Bell was a little bit more aligned maybe a little â€“ maybe a little bit of that and we'll continue to reshape that customer mix a bit but much smaller scale than Verizon was in a bit of a different dynamic there. And then some of the other ones I think are more more in line with kind of the overall customer profile or much smaller in their overall scope. So there's certainly some of that you inevitably see in M&A but I wouldn't see anything on the horizon that would meaningfully tick that up.Sure. Let me â€“ yeah and recap I'll give you a little bit of a more holistic view and then comment on Americas. And Keith just commented on this we saw a nice uptick in overall in MRR per cap on a global basis. I think it's driven in meaningful part by significant organic strength in Europe and then some uptick in APAC in definitely with the PI â€“ Power PI and Singapore contributing to that. But more than half of that is really driven on an overall global basis is driven by underlying organic strength in the business. In the Americas we â€“ there are a couple of moving parts there. We've always encouraged people to kind of look at a multi-quarter average since that metric can really be more volatile depending on several factors. And we saw a few of those factors. We saw some settlement activity in the Americas that was a one-time thing. We saw a large install which is not yet ramped. And so you get the cabs but not as much revenue. And then finally we get â€“ had a little bit of a price action associated with the very large renewal we did with NASDAQ which was a huge win for us but had a little bit of downward impact on that. But overall I think nothing of concern. I think the MRR per cab in the Americas is still exceptionally healthy. And I think we'd continue to be able to feel like we can continue to manage it at or above those levels.Keith do you want to comment on the regional strength -- the regional breakout of the MRR system?Sure. Yeah. The power PIs I think it all depends is the answer. Because I think that if we saw a reversion back to meaningfully lower rates then I think we would adjust accordingly. And so I do think that we kind of separate out more of the power-related pricing adjustments associated with power volatility from more structural sort of price levels and margin profiles within the business. And so I think we're just going to have to navigate that in terms of -- but I do think the market saw a big uptick pass through those meaningful adjustments and then saw a reversion I think we would make adjustments there. And so -- but I think it's going to very much depend and be something we'll have to look at on a market-by-market basis. And then pricing I think in terms of its impact on MRR per cab yes I mean I think that as we increase pricing due to various inflationary factors as well as due to the continued strength of our value proposition and our ability to continue to add more value for our customers I think that's going to have a positive impact on our MRR per cab and just allow us to continue to preserve margins and drive the appropriate returns on capital. So we're going to have to continue to monitor that in terms of just how with the pace and the level of the inflationary forces in the business are. But right now I think we've demonstrated that across the board we can make appropriate pricing adjustments and therefore feel like we can preserve that MRR per cab trajectory.,0.003764485,0.007884562,0.001699132
99,99,DUK,Good,: Thank you.: Good morning David.: Yeah we can. Thank you.: David the thing I would point to as I look at â€˜24-â€˜25-â€˜26 we will be ramping renewable construction in the regulated business in a much more significant way than the short term the '22-'23 that your customers are seeing. So think about the Carolinas. We have not had a renewable build in our capital plan in the Carolinas but that will begin to show up in '24-'25 and '26. We've talked about the fact that we will see an increasing amount of regulated renewables. And that will impact the way we think about capital allocation between regulated and commercial you'll begin to see that in '24-â€˜25.: Absolutely 55-45 55% utility ownership. Yes.: Yes. And David I would say there's been ongoing discussion around clean energy policy around renewable tax credits around supply chain issues really dating back to the end of last year continuing into this one. We shared the goal with the administration of reaching a net-zero future. And so these elements that we're talking about are relevant to that conversation. So we believe a timely and efficient resolution of the Department of Commerce Inquiry is important. We also believe that the renewable tax credits are important for our customers as you think about the level of investment that is planned to reach these goals. So we're very actively engaged in policies that impact our goals for net zero. And I don't see that changing.: Thank you.: Well thank you for participation today for questions for your investment in Duke Energy. And as always we're available if there are questions or further follow-up on anything that we've covered today. And look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks again.,0.002539277,0.002539277,0
100,100,CSX,Foote:,Well I think anybody thatâ€™s followed the railroad business for a long time like you have and everybody else on the call knows that the relationships between the railroads and the union workforce is not necessarily been one of mutual admiration and we need to fix that and we are working extremely hard. And throughout this process we have I mean these guys were out there for two years in the middle of a pandemic working every single day and night in a chaotic operating environment caused by surges in traffic and you name it. And at the same time didnâ€™t get a raise. Thatâ€™s wrong in my opinion. And thatâ€™s why we decided to do something about it unilaterally without asking for some kind of get back in the labor agreement. We just thought it was the right thing to do and so we made the offer and thatâ€™s a change. Itâ€™s not technology. Itâ€™s relationship building with your unionized workforce and we need to change that and we are going to -- we are dedicated to changing that. And it is an ongoing long-term process but CSX is committed to trying to do everything we can possibly do to change decades if not centuries of the somewhat dysfunctional relationship with our human workforce thatâ€™s the key and thatâ€™s what this is all about.So we are not short of locomotives. We are not short of any physical infrastructure in order to be able to perform and that we continue to still have excess capacity across the railroad. There is one thing and one thing only that we are short of that is hampering us from doing the job that we want to do and to get back to the service levels where we were in 2019 and to get even better from that point on is we need more people in the engineer and conductor ranks. Thatâ€™s it. We donâ€™t need them anywhere else in the organization. We donâ€™t need more management people. We donâ€™t need a lot -- we donâ€™t need more people fixing the track and laying rail. They are doing a great job out there. We need more engineers and conductors and thatâ€™s it and thatâ€™s what we are dedicated to do and that is why we will continue to focus on these numbers. And it is a lengthy process from the time we finally get someone it is an extremely lengthy process from the time we start looking for somebody that in this day and age might want to be a railroad conductor until the time they have gone through the classroom. First of all the pre-employment screening then by the time they go through the month or more of classroom instruction and then six months on the job training and then we have to make sure at that point in time they are equipped and ready to go out and work in a railroad operating environment and not get hurt and not hurt somebody else. Itâ€™s a long long process and thatâ€™s why it has taken so long. As I said earlier nine months longer because of the front end of the process was not went away from us. The pipeline of normal candidate that might want to -- usually wanted to work in the railroad business they donâ€™t want to go to work. They wanted to stay home. They wanted to do something else. And so we have had to revamp work extremely hard and now we are beginning to realize the benefits of all that hard work and itâ€™s going to be month after month after month after month with these employees are then qualified they actually go out and start performing work and as the year goes on on a month-to-month-to-month basis we will see continued improvements in fluidity and increases in the speed of the network when the net -- so you have got a compounding effect. You are short of employees and you canâ€™t run the trains so the network slows down. When the network slows down you need more people. So we need to get the railroad back staffed so that we can get the velocity and dwell down to where it was that will then right-size our workforce to what we need and then we can more effectively manage it with the view that Kevin and his team provide us about where the opportunity is. Listen they are not -- Kevin and his team are not shy about telling us on a regular basis where they see opportunity. Itâ€™s out there. And we want to get it we want to move it because thatâ€™s what we do and make a lot of money doing it.Well I would hope again I hate to give projections because I was already off by nine months on the last one. We will -- yeah you will see Mr. Boychuk always gets nervous when I start making projections. I wonder railroad is going to start running better. The railroad will start running better in this quarter and it will get better in the third quarter and it will get better in the fourth quarter. And the operating performance of the company I hope then will continue to get better and better and better and better all the time. 2019 was not nirvana. 2019 is the base camp we want to get back to where we were which was record level of performance but there was not where we were satisfied being the way we wanted to run the company and run the railroad. We wanted to get even better from there and we hopefully will be able to do that. But itâ€™s going to be a gradual improvement as we go through the remainder of this year.Well I think we are leading the industry in intermodal growth. So it is not in terms of volume. I think if not this year next year for sure. In terms of volume intermodal is going to be our biggest piece of business. That being said so we want to -- we spent a lot of time and effort in 2017 and 2018 in re-engineering the way the intermodal network operated for reasons so that we could have a good return on that business when we began to focus more intently on working in the key lanes where it makes sense for us to grow. We are beginning to I think have a better understanding of leveraging the East Coast ports which have gone through a dramatic transformation in terms of growth versus the West Coast and have the much greater opportunity to expand that footprint in the East than they do in the West. And we are also working more and more and more at how we can participate in the Mexican intermodal market which to-date we do basically nothing in. So whether itâ€™s international or domestic the more players put asset towards the intermodal market the more these markets further develop we see great potential for us to continue to grow our intermodal franchise. Thatâ€™s not to say that we are in any way shape or form favoring that over the merchandise business. The merchandise business is a core part of our franchise. So we intend to grow both of these businesses. We see both of them as equal opportunity. Any business has a divergent book of business and so we donâ€™t -- we look at them both as exciting areas of opportunity.Again thatâ€™s a different book of business. Personally I am more in favor of us being more involved on an asset ownership basis because we see great opportunity there for potential and whether itâ€™s UMAX or whether itâ€™s every place else I donâ€™t like the model where 95% of the work and get 75% of the money. So to the extent that we can turn some of this business around and make it more favorable to our bottomline I can guarantee you that any kind of an investment in asset in that area would have a great return.Thanks.,0.002612606,0.002700865,7.77E-05
101,101,WM,Rankin:,Yes that's correct Michael.So it's really interesting when you look at the margin of the quarter it certainly outperformed our expectation and that started at the top line and continued through in terms of managing costs which John mentioned earlier particularly on the labor side. I think what's important is that you normalize for the fuel tax credit first because that really gets us focused on the rest of the business and how we've performed. And that was 30 basis points. And so when you look at Q1's performance and you can see that we were only down 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis and that compares to our expectation that we'd be down about 100 basis in the first half. We're certainly very pleased with that performance. The overall puts and takes just to build the bridge is that I would tell you the positive drivers from a margin perspective in the quarter were 20 basis points from the renewable energy business about 10 basis points for leverage on SG&A beyond expectations. Recycling this is the brokerage business. It's led by the brokerage business. It includes all elements of the recycling line of business but that was down 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And then the collection and disposal business overall was down 30 basis points. But what's really important to highlight there is that sequentially improved 50 basis points when you remove the impact of the fuel tax credit. So we're really pleased with that performance and it outpaced our expectations. We still remain cautious about margin in the first half of the year relative to prior year because as a reminder Q2 of last year was I believe an all-time high at 29.3%. So we still expect margins in the first half to be on a year-over-year basis a more difficult comp and therefore a decrease but we expect the margin momentum that we began in the first quarter to continue throughout the year.So I'm going to separate fuel tax credits and the impact of rising fuel costs. But fuel tax credit I would tell you we hope is a timing difference. Our outlook right now is that that 30 basis points may continue and we would love to see resolution sooner rather than later but we think it could go all the way through the fourth quarter but we do expect that to be a timing issue only not contribute to the margin of the business overall. From a diesel fuel rising cost perspective we certainly saw that impact in the first quarter. And like I said earlier at ramp in March we estimate that the impact of that for every dollar change in diesel fuel is about 20 basis points of margin pressure.So Tyler I think the easiest way to look at it we don't have specific breakdowns between open market and restricted prices. But what we've talked about is with rate restricted pricing we do reset about 70% of that in the first half. And so those resets being loaded toward the first half is one of the reasons that we expect the high watermark to exist in the first half relative to the second half and then it comes back to those comps. What I would say is that our pricing on The Street continues to have momentum over the course of the year as our contracts come up particularly on open market and some of the actions that we took and the impact of fuel that we discussed will certainly continue to drive price higher. That's not reflected in your collection and disposal yields. But I really do think that this comes down to being focused on our market-based pricing and knowing that that momentum is not what's flowing it's just the comparisons on a year-over-year basis and the fact that we started to take pricing action more reflective of the cost environment in the second half of last year.And then on the incentive compensation and health and welfare specifically what I would tell you is I do think that incentive compensation could modestly increase over the remainder of the year from the Q1 level just as we get further into the year we'll get finer on our estimates and outlook and therefore the accruals. But with regard to health and welfare we are seeing the trends of those costs return to pre-COVID levels where medical activity is getting back to normal. And as a result those costs are pretty well in line with what we would have expected. They do tend to moderate over the remainder of the year but nothing unusual on a year-over-year basis.So Sean I think fundamentally what this comes back to is us not wanting to be in a position to revise guidance across the board after just one quarter. And so the overall trend that we expected where our first half comps are just going to be tougher from a margin perspective than the second half comps. And therefore we will relatively underperform our full year outlook in the first half and see a build as we get into the third quarter in terms of margin performance still holds. In terms of the magnitude of it I think Tyler's question earlier about the impact of fuel framing that as about a 20 to 40 basis point impact given what we're seeing in diesel fuels we're pretty satisfied that we're going to be able to absorb the negative impacts of that. And so when we look at full year outlook for margin we do see some upside particularly because price has come in so strong and we've seen positive momentum on retention. It's just too early for us to update the specificity with regard to how we see that flowing through for the rest of the year.Yes. So it was $12 million for the quarter. The full year impact is expected to be a little north of $55 million. So the impact for the remainder of the year we estimate to be about $45 million. We fully expect that we'll end the year with some clarity on this. But if we don't receive that clarity it would be about a $55 million to $60 million negative impact relative to the guidance that we've provided.I don't have the specifics on that. Ed and Heather will be able to get you more color. The only thing that we provide is the year-over-year increase in that was $13 million of a year-over-year benefit in the quarter. The color there I would give you is that we estimate that for every $0.10 change in RIN values we see a $4 million to $5 million change in our EBITDA and that continues to hold through 2022 we will see that increase as we get into '23 with additional production.I think well I may have said it a couple of tons already. I do think some of it becomes about the math. And I don't intend to make it overly simple in terms of looking at that. But next year's Q1 comp will be very difficult. We do think there is benefit from the rate reset on the restricted part of the book because this year's reset didn't fully contemplate all of the inflationary impact because they are backward looking. So we think there will be another step change in that part of the business a year from now. In terms of our activity on the street I think it's important to know we are assuming thatâ€™s slowing this momentum down. So we would like to create some decrease in the cost inflation environment that would allow us to view this a little bit differently going forward. And I just want to focus on customer lifetime value. We'll always ensure that we're being data-driven and customer presence in how we push our pricing efforts.We generally look at our cost of inflation at 3% to 4%. So just the normal course would be at that level. And so you can see that we're meaningfully higher than that now. our expectation in the back half of the year isn't necessarily that we get all the way back down to 3% to 4% that we land somewhere in the teens.,0.003700584,0.006326914,0.001517774
102,102,AON,about,Aon we will continue to improve performance driving revenue growth higher revenue growth higher-margin investments organically and inorganically and continue to divest lower-revenue growth lower-margin portions of our portfolio.

103,103,SLB,Le,Peuch: Hey Neil.Peuch: The main agenda as you know I think would be to achieve 2 or 3 key elements. The first is to lay out our updated view of the mid- and long-term outlook for our industry. And of course the engines that we want to participate fully into the core the digital and new energy and as such document our view of the market scenario and the way our play will expose us to fully participate in each of these three. The second obviously will be to articulate the elements of the strategy that will make you understand the tangible progress we have made the critical milestones weâ€™ll meet by 2025 or by 2030. And finally weâ€™ll document I will say our financial ambition and financial and capital framework to support this ambition of our strategic execution for the next 5 years and with the long horizon of 2030 for a target. So thatâ€™s what we are aiming to achieve this Capital Market Day.Peuch: I think generally speaking I think it is not only Saudi Aramco or Saudi and UAE. I think it is the GCC countries and includes Iraq as well I think that set are for a significant rebound in both short cycle to respond to the unlocking the quota at the end of the year and then long cycle with capacity expansion commitments that several countries have made. So we expect the consequence of that would be first in the second half of the year activity will start to see an uptick in the form of short cycle and that will affect both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. And we will see also this expanding into offshore and onshore capacity expansion more into 2023. As you know several contracts have been put in place to support this capacity expansion by this operator with first and the industry at large. And this will see an acceleration of investment in 2023 that will expand beyond the short-cycle visibly into this new development new capacity beyond what is happening today on gas and unconventional happening today in some of the integrated contract we already own. So itâ€™s -- it will be widespread I would say and across the --all the divisions as we move into 2023.Peuch: Thank you.Peuch: No it remains â€“ our new energy remains a critical strategic pillar of our long-term strategy. So we are set to continue to invest into the venture we have created. We are making tactical moves and strategic moves to accelerate organic and inorganic investment. And we continue to monitor the market and continue to hedge and grew exposure to this. So the market condition that have slightly changed in last few weeks do not change our view on the new energy outlook. We have been seeing some reinvestments and you have seen this during the quarter into geothermal as an alternate source of energy. You have seen that geoenergy being through the Celsius Energy venture that we have created was - is- a domain that was identified by EU the European Union to be invested in to substitute gas and hence to lessen the dependency on single source of supply on gas. And I think you can certainly anticipate and see that CCS at large is growing as an opportunity for oil industry. And for us as we work not only with industry as you have seen the announcement we made with PETRONAS but also we are working beyond the industry as you have seen previous engagement we have and continue to do so. So I think we continue to develop and mature the technology ready for scaling them and we continue to make organic investments and securing inorganic opportunity to augment our capability into that space.Peuch: I think we have been commenting on this before. And I think weâ€™ll provide a very comprehensive view at our Capital Markets Day. And I think the biggest and long-term bigger potential is both on CCS and hydrogen market we believe first and foremost. And believe that the energy storage including lithium processing or extraction as well as energy stationary energy storage as well as geo-energy geothermal are certainly shorter-term and mid-term opportunity that weâ€™ll not miss to secure. But weâ€™ll come back with more detail and more a better framework for you to understand our ambition there.Peuch: Thank you.Peuch: Good morning Connor.Peuch: No. First I think the OPEC+ indeed has been very strict into implementing the policy in respect to the quota. Second I think with very few exceptions the GCC has been able to indeed unlock this production without significant at this moment significant increase in short cycle activity to support that increase. This will position into necessary investment into supporting the sustained capacity in the coming months. Until then and until now it has been that the production of some critical countries were below their sustained capacity potential hence the need for reinvesting the need for accelerating investment drilling or intervention was measured and was not necessarily disproportionate compared to the past. I think you will see that transitioning into the second half and accelerating next year and it will combine with a capacity expansion they have committed to. So they will be a hike in activity on two fronts the short cycle to this time sustain maximum capacity that is established and an investment that will expand this sustained capacity in the future. So that is set to happen. It wasnâ€™t necessarily a big surprise to us. I think that Middle East was a bit of behind in terms of activity rebound internationally until now but you will see this catching up in the second half and accelerating in 2023.Peuch: I think itâ€™s obviously an extremely dynamic situation. For one the sanction is certainly having an impact on the Russian economy and our operation will not be immune to this effect. But as currently currency fluctuation as you have seen our customer activity level today or tomorrow. So â€“ and there is also possibility of further sanction so the impact of the first quarter as you have seen was essentially limited to currency depreciation and dilution. Itâ€™s very difficult at the moment to predict what the impact may be in an upcoming quarter considering the uncertainty. On the flip side as Iâ€™ve described the environment that we see and the dynamics we see in the market and the anticipated response to this call for energy security is creating the condition to offset this uncertainty and offset this risk. And also the decision we have made to suspend new investment will mean that we will be able to allocate this CapEx to this upcoming opportunity effective this year and then being able to capture this upside in activity in this dynamic environment. And as you say should allow us to offset and keep our financial ambition intact.Peuch: Thank you.Peuch: Good morning Roger.Peuch: I think there are 2 elements I think we need to-- we should really -- separate here. The first is the transitory temporary impact we have had on the excessive cost of logistics and delivery supply chain bottleneck that we have to work through that had led to temporary costs that I think will over time abate and will reduce as we work through this supply chain. We have a corrective action plan with diversification of source of supply using different logistics routes and you heard about our commitment to some critical safety stock for inventory to secure less disruption going forward. So this disruption aside that has had consequential cost supplementary cost impact I think we expect this to be more subdued as we go forward and we start to accelerate our conversion of our backlog. So what do we need? I think we have already this in the backlog. We have a very big backlog that we have accumulated for the last few quarters that we keep growing. And itâ€™s not only subsea. Our Production Systems is made of subsea as I mentioned I think we are very proud of some of our market position in subsea including what we have seen in Norway but also have a completion with a few contracts that we won in the Middle East in Brazil in particular artificial lift PCP pumps that you have seen that we have won just in Kuwait with very good position; Production chemicals that are being pulled as well. And our midstream and surface Cameron capability that are fully leveraging particularly surface the upcycling in North America. So if you combine all of these we have not only short-cycle exposure with surface in North America of completions artificial lift we have long cycle with deepwater and some of our long-cycle participation into some gas facility as I mentioned in Turkey. You combine all this and you have enough backlog to lift and create an uplift into our growth going forward and actually indicative of Production Systems to be accretive to our growth in the second half.Peuch: I think I will not try to compare Russia margin with the rest of our portfolio. I think I will look at it from strength of the cycle from the lead market position we have and from the starting point we have today with having restructured and reset operating leverage the exposure with digital the exposure with an increasing offshore long- and short-cycle mix; I think these attributes that convince us that our margin will continue to expand. As we have seen this quarter we have increased year-on-year both NAM and international margin. And we have been posting the best margin since then 2015. And yet despite an impact in the first quarter from Russia. So I think weâ€™re looking at it as you say the big picture. The big picture includes investment in oil and gas for energy security diversification that will have a call on international supply as well as in North America and an increasing mix of short and long cycle as capacity needs to be expanded and the reserves that have been depleted through the last down-cycle for the last seven years will need to be expanded again. So that mix is what makes us confident into our trajectory of margin expansion and into the potential uniqueness of this upcycle compared to past and hence the confidence we have in a short- and long-term.Peuch: I think I cannot be speculating on this market condition. I think you see the same numbers as we do see. You see that there is as I said a potential risk of Russia supply dislocation. I think what is important is that the demand trajectory that is recovering and is set to further increase next year compared to previous prediction not only to offset that but to also respond to the market I think will be contributing to overall growth so itâ€™s very difficult to predict. I think we are â€“ this is a very dynamic situation. And we are not here to speculate on that dynamic situation. We know that we have to account for assumption that it could be a demand dislocation. It could be a demand or supply disruption from the Russia source of supply. Hence we know and we have seen our customer rotating and starting to anticipate and position themselves for participating to the call on supply that will happen from the second half of this year and the years to come. So thatâ€™s the only thing we can come up with.Peuch: So again we cannot speculate on this. I think we -- our first and foremost priority is to look after the safety of our people everywhere we operate including Russia and to comply with the utmost diligence to the sanction â€“ international sanctions that are in place. To speculate about what are the consequences of the sanction onto the OFS industry in Russia I think is something that the future will tell us what is happening. But I think I donâ€™t want to be in a position to comment on this at this moment.Peuch: Thank you very much. I believe that itâ€™s time to close this call. So in conclusion I would like to leave you with 3 takeaways. Firstly our first-quarter financial results represent a strong start to what promises to be a significant year for the company. In particular the resilience and strength of our core services Divisions and the full participation in the fast-growing North America market have contributed to a very solid year-on-year growth and margins expansion. Secondly the activity outlook is shaping up favorably as 2022 progresses and is set to support our full-year mid-teens growth ambition despite the uncertainties in our Russia operations. Furthermore in the later part of the year we will gain from improving market conditions favorable activity mix in key offshore basins and the Middle East and broader net pricing impact across North America and international markets. Our confidence in the favorable market conditions and our mid-term outlook supports our margin expansion ambition and our commitment to generate double-digit free cash flow. As a result we have decided to accelerate cash returns to shareholders through a visible increase in our dividend. Finally we believe that the consequences of the current crisis will reinforce the market fundamentals for a stronger and longer upcycle as the priority on energy security will favor reinvestment in oil and gas supply. Consequently the outlook for the next few years is improving and absent a global economic setback should translate into an exceptional sequence for the industry.

104,104,NOC,Warden:,Yes. So I should have been more clear extra pointing that out. We do expect more costless work in space over the next couple of years as GBSD continues to grow. Weâ€™re also executing on next generation interceptor which is a big growth driver and then some assorted classified efforts that are in the development phase in continuing to scale as well. In terms of other businesses that are moving in the opposite direction so stronger margin rates aeronautics is one that we see having stronger margin rates. Youâ€™ll â€“ you already see that in our guide for this year being higher than last. And we anticipate that weâ€™ll continue to see strong and healthy margin rates there. Defense and mission systems already perform at very strong margin rates. So we expect that to continue but the real offset that we see is space and aero. And I will also say that in space weâ€™ve seen the bulk of that pressure already because keep in mind while GBSD will continue to grow in the EMV phase not to the extent that weâ€™ve seen it went from a couple hundred million a year to over $2 billion. And so over this time period and the majority of that will already have happened through the 2022 period.Yes. So thereâ€™s a lot to unpack there. Let me start with commentary around rocket motor providers. We are performing well across the Board for our primes and we do not believe that any comments that were made relate to Northrop Grumman performance. We continue to offer our capability to any who would like to have our rocket motors and weâ€™re going to continue to do that. And weâ€™re investing in that business to make sure that we are a good and stable performer and provider. In terms of our exposure to Ukraine and Russian rocket motors we do have some exposure on our CRS contract. So this is where your Antares launch vehicle we procure rocket motors from Russia and of course from Ukraine. We have what we need for the next two launches. And so there isnâ€™t the immediate disruption and we have a plan in place that we could use other sources if needed beyond those two launches. But of course itâ€™s our preference to keep the relationships intact between Russia and the U.S. around the space station. And thatâ€™s what these rocket motors are used for to take cargo to the international space station. But we are working closely with NASA to make sure weâ€™re following the U.S. government lead in that case.Well itâ€™s an excellent strategic question Kristine and one that we spend a good time deal of time thinking about. And I will say our first priority is investing in the business and you have seen us invested in elevated level both CapEx as well as there are R&D is the percentage of sales over the last several years and we are not backing away from that core part of our strategy. I noted when I laid out our strategic plan that technology leadership and innovation is core to how we have attained the position that weâ€™re in and in my view will be the most important factor to retaining that position of strength. And so we will continue to invest in our business but with that said strong cash flows. And as you noted as strong outlook for growth to fuel those cash flows gives a us a lot of optionality in our capital deployment strategy. We do believe that at some point M&A may come back on the table but for the immediate term as you said large needle moving M&A is likely not to be strategy that we can execute. And so we are looking at returning capital to our shareholders at this important time through a competitive dividend and share buyback. We do tend to prefer share repurchase in this environment just to give us a little more flexibility as environmental factors change but share repurchase itâ€™s still a core part of our strategy but itâ€™s by no means the only method that we believe we create value for shareholders and we stay focused on investing in our company.Yes. Cai we do not expect book-to-bill to be over one this year. It is off to a stronger start than we expected. And so I will be clear. It is likely to be higher than we anticipated coming into the year but still donâ€™t see it crossing the 1.0 threshold and space is a key driver as you noted of that strength but we see broad strength in booking this year beyond what we had expected some nice competitive wins in our Defense Systems business and our aero business also having strong awards particularly as we look to book lot 15 aggregate demand on F-35 this year. What we look at and Iâ€™ve mentioned this on prior calls is a multi-year book-to-bill. And so having a portfolio where weâ€™ve brought in some very sizeable long-term awards like B-21 and GBSD we have a backward looking book-to-bill over 1.2 aggregate for the last three years. And so we donâ€™t expect to have that kind of performance in book-to-bill every year but we still expect our four-year average once we take 22 into consideration to be well over 1.1. So sustaining the backlog growth that we need to fuel the business growth we anticipate.I would just say that we see an environment where we can keep that multi-year average well above one.Thank you.So Myles I wouldnâ€™t point to any one part of our business where we are seeing dramatic impacts. Aero where we have high volume line in F-35 we saw last year and we talked about that quite clearly. As we got into the first quarter of this year and the plan that we laid in place we are meeting that plan on F-35 but there was impact. And we still are working to address that impact on the F-35. Other than that thereâ€™s really no single program or area of the business that I point to just a little bit of sluggish attendance coming into this year due to COVID cases some light impact on electronic supply both to Mission Systems and Defense Systems but nothing material enough to really call out individually.Well I would point you to the [indiscernible] So the budget does not show a peak revenue year through fiscal year 2027. So I canâ€™t provide you much more than that because quantities and the like are classified. But if you just look at what was in the â€“ what the administration submitted now of course this has to go through appropriations and itâ€™s always subject to annual revision as well. But what was submitted this year for the five year outlook does not show a peak year through 2027. Does that help?Well I canâ€™t really comment on B-21 mix of EMD and production rate. And so let me go straight to your broader strategic question which is an important one on whether the government will likely shift away from fixed price development. I do believe that there will be a shift away. And I think weâ€™ve already seen that to a large degree. And frankly B-21 well we were asked to bid fixed price LRIP. We did not have a fixed price development phase of that program. And thereâ€™s a very important distinction in my mind between production even early stages of production at fixed price and the development phase being at fixed price. And of course GBSD is a cost plus development program. So thatâ€™s why I suggest that we are already seeing a shift on major weapons systems developments to a costless development phase which in my mind has always been the right approach for the government to contract for development. By definition there is inherent technology development and risk associated with that phase. And you want to be able to apply resources to reduce that risk into production. And if the government doesnâ€™t have that latitude because theyâ€™re set at fixed price then the contractor has to do that often out of their own profit which is really tough decisions to make. And I think it impacts the ability then for the program to be successful over the full life cycle. And of course the majority of the governmentâ€™s costs are in the production and sustainment phases of the life cycle not development. But I think the government recognizes this and itâ€™s why weâ€™ve seen a shift away from fixed price development on these large weapons systems. Now there still will be some fixed price development in the system but I donâ€™t see it being a material driver.Well George as you know we did look at the entirety of our portfolio and divested the IT services business that was in defense. And we were very intentional and thoughtful about that but we looked at the rest of the portfolio and feel that it has nice energy with our business. And we do see opportunity to grow that business. Just a little bit of reset here that the business is experiencing. But the weapons portfolio continues to grow and we have nice synergy between the aircraft sustainment and modernization and our aeronautics business. And our IBCS portfolio sits in there and we absolutely is that program now is maturing and weâ€™ve won full rate production sea growth there. So weâ€™re happy with the portfolio a little bit of transition to growth that weâ€™re still working our way through here. But no nothing else that I would look to the best in that portfolio right now.And thatâ€™s probably a place to leave it. I think we are blessed to have a lot of A teams. So thanks everybody for calling in today and listening to our call. As always we wish you well and look forward to talking to you again in July. Take care.,0.003427112,0.005882621,0.001237877
105,105,CME,Duffy:,Okay Owen. Sean do you want to take the first part about the crypto? Or would you...Kyle itâ€™s Terry Duffy. Let me take the back part of that question on the regulatory side and Iâ€™ll let Sunil Cutinho take the front side which is the risk management. So on the regulatory front youâ€™d be purely speculating on what the agency may or may not do. You got to remember this came out of an FCA-regulated marketplace. The way they tore up trades on one side is something that we do not do here and Sunil can walk you through more of the risk management associated the way we manage risk versus how they manage the risk. Whether the position limits would come under question position limits probably would not have had any effect on what the outcome here was on LME was more on the risk management itself not the exact position limits itself. So the concentration of risk is a different thing than the position limit. So these are different factors. I donâ€™t see our government taking this up in any which way shape or form due to what happened in nickel. I mean thereâ€™d be no reason to. So â€“ but at the same time Iâ€™ll reserve that. I will be testifying in Washington in May not only on a host of things but â€“ not on LME but mostly on risk in general. So that may come up. Weâ€™ll see when â€“ how the Congress feels about it then. So let me ask Sunil to talk more about the risk side.Kyle hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. But I mean again this is their situation not ours and we donâ€™t want to comment too much further on their situation.Chris itâ€™s Terry Duffy. Again as I said Iâ€™ll be testifying on May 12 specifically on this topic along with some other folks. Itâ€™s always difficult to predict what the ultimate outcome is. But I donâ€™t see any knee-jerk reaction into market structure thatâ€™s going to change in any direction. And let me be clear about this. If there is a market structure change in any direction it wonâ€™t preclude CME from participating in such market structure changes that could benefit this immensely if in fact we see that to be the case. I donâ€™t know that to be the case but I donâ€™t want people to think that crypto is the only one that has the ability to have its own separate regulation and the rest of the world has to sit idly by as they go unregulated or exempt from a whole host of issues that weâ€™ve all been in compliance with today. So I do not see that to be an outcome whatsoever. So itâ€™s a very frustrating topic to some degree but at the same time weâ€™ll be patient. Weâ€™ll go through it. Weâ€™ll give our views exactly as it relates to their application. The flaws in their application theyâ€™re glaring they say the least and we will be opposing that application. The industry is very concerned about some of the things there in NetApp. So again you canâ€™t just create an application and pass it because itâ€™s a new asset class. The CFTC also has to look at innovative new products. I will tell you that you cannot say that you have innovation for the sake of innovation. Itâ€™s got to be still under the principles-based regulatory regime that is highly outlined in the CFTC today and you canâ€™t go outside of that just for the sake of innovation. So it will be fascinating to see how this all plays out but I do not see anything playing out in the near term at all.Thank you.Simon Iâ€™ll turn it over to Derek for that response.Derek?Sean?Thanks Sean.Michael itâ€™s Terry Duffy. Obviously M&A is always something that people want to look at. You donâ€™t want to be dismissive of potential opportunities that could benefit your shareholders and obviously your user base to create more efficiencies. You are correct though in your opening statement where you said a lot of it is consolidated in the vertical silos that we have seen around the world already. So the question will be what do you see outside of that. And I think that people are looking multiple different directions of how they can create efficiencies in the businesses. One of the reasons I was so passionate with my team about doing the Google transaction it allowed us to have the greatest technology in the world as we implement new products coming across which might create opportunities that we donâ€™t even know today or tomorrow as it relates to M&A. So I think thatâ€™s how people are going to be looking at it. Youâ€™re correct though the landscape has shrunk over the last decade. And the deals that we all used to talk about 10 12 years ago are pretty much repped up. But we continue to look at it to see how it will benefit CME. But I think again the technology that we have. I canâ€™t emphasize that enough is really important for us as we go forward.Thank you.Yes. Brian I think itâ€™s tough for us to predict that to be honest with you. I think we had a record quarter in our Market Data business which we are extremely excited about. As you know thatâ€™s been a problem for us over the years and we really got Julie Winkler to her credit itâ€™s gotten that business and growing it exponentially. Good job. The beauty around the Google transaction is what I said earlier it just allows us to do so many different things going forward. So Iâ€™m really excited by that transaction. Whether we can put revenue associated and I think thatâ€™s really premature I think as I said it just opens up so many different opportunities for CME going forward not just in market data but many other businesses as we referenced. Julie do you want to comment any further?Okay Brian.Appreciated.Let me thank you all again for joining us today. We appreciate it very much. Weâ€™re quite proud of our quarter. We will continue to work as we go through the balance of the year. So thank you all very much. Stay safe stay healthy. Thank you.,0.002489249,0.002588093,0.00011663
106,106,SNPS,de,Geus : Youâ€™re welcome.Geus : Yeah. We're in early stage. And typically we don't disclose for individual products. But both of these areas have the potential to certainly grow faster than the rest of the company because they're in the early stage but also because they bring a whole set of new values to the customer. And back to an earlier question I didn't mention that in both of those areas we also hire more people in order to help our customers succeed and quickly get to the high value that these capabilities offer.Geus : Youâ€™re welcome.Geus : Okay. I'm very clear about this. I think that we are into a long-term great opportunity wave. Because the opportunity to change how the world operates with the combination of enormous amount of data combined with machine learning ultimately AI and automation has very very big economic impact for every vertical. And so while one could argue that for many decades Moore's Law has sort of pushed technology forward and that always had new benefits. Now there is simultaneously a pool from end markets that all realize that hey they could potentially shave some economics out of their operations by just understanding the data better or even find better solutions. And I think that is so profound that is as profound I would say as computation 35 years or 30 years ago impacting the world. Now at the same time we are all well aware that there are some shortage of certain -- actually a fairly limited set but crucial set of parts. And I'm hesitate to call that a cycle. There have been interruptions in the supply chains due to global politics. There have been COVID that stop people from ordering. There have been a lot of things and it's mostly older parts. And so yes there's some shortage there. There's some additional capacity being built in. Most of the capacity is being lined up for actually advanced nodes because of the earlier point I made all these new opportunities. And so there will be always a little bit of a cycle of supply and providers alignment. But in general I think that we're in for a decade of great opportunities in semiconductors. By the way I should add that includes us of course. Yeah that was maybe the end of the key part of the question for Synopsys. Yeah we're very much in the middle of that. And we love this term of being a catalyst because we interact with literally the deepest technology with the design with the system configuring the optimization there all the way into the software and the security. And so it puts us very much in a position to interact with all the players that have to interact well for success. And that's where a big part of our enthusiasm comes from.Geus: Youâ€™re welcome.,0.003979772,0.005277514,0.001297742
107,107,EOG,Yacob:,Yes Arun. This is Ezra. I can start right there with where you left off pardon me let me say that. Weâ€™re just thrilled to be in a unique position here to be able to strengthen the balance sheet and return $2.4 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2022. But ultimately with the remaining 40% it comes back to the fact that weâ€™re committed to delivering on our free cash flow priorities and doing the right thing at the right time to maximize long-term shareholder value. And it does include that balance sheet. And some of the things with the balance sheet weâ€™ve discussed in the past is to have cash available just for running the business for operations to have cash for the small bolt-on acquisitions. As you mentioned to have cash available for the $5 billion stock repurchase authorization which weâ€™ve said we prefer to look at that as an opportunistic repurchase rather than something more programmatic. And then the last thing with regards to our balance sheet and cash on hand would also be our commitment there to retiring a bond a $1.2 billion bond thatâ€™s coming due here in the first quarter of 2023. So really as we started off with the guide of returning a minimum of 60% of free cash flow itâ€™s really not a change in strategy by any means. Itâ€™s just a to provide a little more transparency a little more clarity weâ€™ve heard some of our shareholders who have asked for a bit more transparency and clarity on the cash returns and thatâ€™s really what the change in messaging is but our strategy remains very consistent.Yes Jeanine. No we donâ€™t believe thatâ€™s a suboptimal place in an industry like ours thatâ€™s proven to be cyclical in nature obviously. And at times very volatile even our current cash position Iâ€™d say the cash on hand is a percent of market cap places us roughly in the upper half of the S&P 500. And we think thatâ€™s a fantastic position to be in especially when you think about a cyclical industry like ours.Yes Leo. This is Ezra. Let me maybe make a few comments and then Lance can follow-up on some more detailed LNG perspectives. In general what I would say from the macro perspective I know this will sound a little bit repetitive but we based our decisions on investment and gas. The same as we do on investment in oil and thatâ€™s on the premium price deck. So for us it really comes down to the first question is returns. How quickly can we invest in an asset and still generate high returns year-over-year still continue to improve upon the asset. And what that means is lowering the finding and development cost every year and bringing adding lower cost reserves to the base of our company. Thatâ€™s how we drop the cost base of the company and basically expand the margins going forward. With regards to global supply and demand that comes in second same as on the oil side. I wouldnâ€™t say that we have an optimal level growth because obviously thereâ€™s associated gas but then weâ€™ve got these pure dry gas plays. So we look at them a little bit agnostically. Long-term how we do feel going out longer and thinking about the long-term global energy solution we do feel the gas is going to play a significant role in that. And thatâ€™s why weâ€™re very committed to the $2.50 price that we evaluate the reinvestment on because we think thatâ€™s globally going to be a very competitive and compelling price to be able to base the investments on. Lance?Yes Neal. We like to have confidence in what weâ€™re talking about and bringing out to the public and what that means for us these days and weâ€™ve talked about it a little bit before is these days itâ€™s not just a matter of trying to find oil or gas that has become relatively not too difficult. The challenge for us is to make sure that itâ€™s additive to the quality of our inventory. Like I said earlier we believe weâ€™ve got the â€“ really the highest quality and deepest inventory across a multi-basin portfolio as far as North American E&P companies go. And so trying to add to that trying to add to the double premium rates of return program is challenging and what it takes is long â€“ some longer-term production results before we going back to Dorado and the Powder River Basin before we announced those basins to the public we had some pretty significantly long production results to really make sure that we had captured what we had anticipated capturing. Last thing we wanted to do is mislead anybody. And so especially looking at some of the new plays that weâ€™re talking about with these hybrid reservoirs these things are relatively new in nature to the industry. And so gathering some longer-term production results and appraisal wells to really define the extent to these plays is very important and critical before weâ€™d be comfortable talking about them.Yes Neil this is Ezra. Itâ€™s great to have such high quality inventory across multiple basins. It makes our job with capital allocation and portfolio management Iâ€™m exciting. The way we approach each of them is looking at where theyâ€™re individually at in the life cycle play and basing off on returns. And so even though the Eagle Ford in there certainly not a growth asset anymore. But by right sizing that program last year I think we highlighted this in February. Last year we turned in the highest rate of return drilling program we ever had in that play. When you think about a play like the Eagle Ford thatâ€™s really a trailblazing type of asset for the entire industry to see how to continue to make one of these resource plays long life resource plays even better year after year after 12 or 13 years of drilling it. So when we think about the Delaware basin the Powder River basin and Dorado just at the high level we would say the Delaware basin is kind of in the sweet spot as far as drilling activity our knowledge base infrastructure. And the PRB and Dorado are a little bit behind that. We definitely slowed down as Ken had mentioned we paused drilling in Dorado during 2020 and we did the same in the Powder River basin. And so weâ€™re early in the life on those plays and so the capital allocation of those two really progresses with the build out of infrastructure and at the pace of which we can incorporate our learnings and continue to make the wells better.Yes Neil. Iâ€™ll start with the second one and reiterate our position on exit to exit U.S. oil hasnâ€™t really changed since February when you look at kind of the range of forecasts that are out there. Weâ€™re on the lower end is the way that we set it in February and thatâ€™s what we would stick to today. We think the supply chain constraints and the inflationary issues the discipline that youâ€™re seeing in North American E&P sector we think that the U.S. exit to exit oil production growth is going to be on the lower end of most of the forecasts. Longer term with the structural implications for Russian capacity for U.S. and global and how that plays in. Weâ€™re watching that the same as everyone else. We have â€“ itâ€™s a volatile situation. There are things developing as we speak including the sanctions that are being discussed. And how are those Russian barrels actually continuing to flow and how are they getting discounted and where are they showing up and what is that doing? Ultimately I take a bigger step back and just say for the last few years Neil weâ€™ve been pretty consistent with our model that chronic underinvestment and exploration in our industry is really going to lead to generally lower supply under supplied for the global supply and demand market longer term. Thatâ€™s why we continue to explore and we continue to explore for lower cost higher return assets. And we think that really â€“ as weâ€™ve said in the past thereâ€™s only a handful of North American E&P companies that have the asset quality the size the scale to compete on a global scale with that cost of supply. And on top of that deliver the barrels with the lower environmental footprint. And in the future those are the companies that the worldâ€™s going to want to fill in additional barrels. And especially with our operational results in this first quarter we think we know â€“ we feel that EOG is a leader of that group of North American E&Ps.Thank you Neil.Yes. Paul this is Ezra. I think I can answer both of those questions almost in the same manner. When we came out with the 8% to 10% growth which was maybe close to 20 months ago now. That was â€“ and I think we said at that time itâ€™s dynamic at that time that 8% to 10% model was reflective of what we could do to optimize near-term and long-term free cash flow with the current inventory and our current knowledge base. And as you can see things continue to change for the better for us. We continue to drive down costs. We continue to drive forward each of our letâ€™s call them emerging place with the Powder River basin and Dorado. And so when we talk about whatâ€™s a good growth rate going forward it comes back to those two things that I started off the call with Doug with the first his optimizing our returns investing at a pace where we can really create long-term shareholder value. And you do that through adding lower cost reserves to the base of the company. So driving down the cost base of the company while also reinvesting so that you can turn your cash over quickly. Our wells this year itâ€™s strip price since we base it on a $40 investment. What that really translates to wells that pay out on average in two to three months right now on the strip price. So itâ€™s a fantastic place to be and itâ€™s really strengthening the base of the business and the company going forward. With regards to the PRB it falls under the same type of line. It all depends on how we build out our infrastructure in that basin and moving out of pace to be able to incorporate our learnings to drive down the well costs. Last quarter I think we highlighted we had dropped the Niobrara well cost pretty significantly over the past year 2021 which was just tremendous results. And as we continue to see progress like that we feel more confident to go ahead and allocate more capital to that portfolio â€“ to that basin.Yes. Weâ€™d like to thank everyone for participating on the call this morning. And thanks to our shareholders for your support. We especially want to recognize each of our employees for their commitment to excellence and on delivering such an outstanding start to the year for EOG.,0.004319382,0.010279596,0.00298273
108,108,CL,Wallace:,Sure. Listen I mean we expect obviously that we will not only hold but ultimately build share with this relaunch Jason thatâ€™s the intent. I mean we have significant investment planned behind this relaunch. It is the number one brand in China has incredible salience. Weâ€™re putting in improved technology as well. We have an innovation stream thatâ€™s coming behind this. Now there is no question there is always risk when you change a brand name but all of the work that weâ€™ve done thus far and what weâ€™ve seen early days that transition really started at the tail end of January early February the bulk of it starting to happen in March. And as I mentioned will unfold more than likely over the next couple â€“ 2 to 3 months. We will know by the end of the second quarter third quarter where we are. We will get a good sense particularly in the online world. As I mentioned the vast majority â€“ the fastest-growing channel is online in China. And we will get a read pretty quickly in how we are doing relative to our online business with Darlie in that market. But overall this is a widely distributed product very very strong obviously gets into C D and E cities. So itâ€™s widely distributed. It will take time to work through the old product but we are starting to see some of the new product already on shelf in the modern trade and so far so good. But I would say give us another quarter the balance of this quarter to really assess how we are doing and come back to you with the point of view as we move into the third quarter.Sure. Lauren let me just clarify. We have not had supply chain issues in Latin America. The supply chain issues and the volatility that we have seen has principally been driven by the North America complexities that we have incurred as well as some shortfalls from some of our raw material suppliers in the middle of the quarter in Europe which created obviously some constraints there. So specifically itâ€™s been North America driven by some lockdown issues in China as well as some of the COVID-related issues we had in some of our facilities here in North America. So as I mentioned we feel very good about where we have now in March. Structurally things have gotten much better efficiencies in the plant asset utilization capacity output all are moving in the right direction which are good indications that we are moving to where we want to be. And as I mentioned some of the service level challenges that we have had. And I think everyone has moved through but we were somewhat exacerbated by those in terms of our ability to get what we needed into some of our key customers are now back to historical high levels. So good news there no issue Latin America. On Europe specifically had dealt with a some raw material shortages that came from some of our suppliers mid-quarter. So that was after we discussed it we set guidance in January that particularly hit us in Europe and that has now moved behind us and things are back to a much more normalized level. We see that quite frankly all around the world. I mean if you look at a number of issues that we dealt with in 2021 and moving into the quarter this year with raw material suppliers or contractors those seem to have subsided. Letâ€™s watch it carefully because anything can happen in the current world given the uncertainty that everyone is faced with. But we have put a lot more resilience into the system now to deal with some of the unforeseen circumstances that we are seeing. Listen in terms of visibility Lauren we were â€“ we came out of last year understanding that we were faced with $750 million of incremental cost and we had the pricing in place to deal with that. And the gross margins came in more or less in line actually just slightly below where we expected a little bit above guidance to the Street in the first quarter. And then we got hit with the significant incremental increases to the tune of $0.5 billion post the January call which came in mid-Feb and into March. So thatâ€™s been the single biggest issue in terms of visibility for us. We did not anticipate those. We had cost becoming more benign in the back half initially when we set guidance obviously with the war all of that change. So the visibility for us became dramatically different as we exited the quarter and hence the change in our guidance that we have communicated today.But no nothing relative to LatAm for themselves they have been able to obviously continue to do what they need to do. But as you know we source quite a bit of product out of Latin America. The costs have gone up but we donâ€™t have anything that we would consider significant there.Sure. Okay. Let me address the supply chain first. Toothbrushes first and foremost is a global supply chain we source predominantly out of Asia as well as some sourcing out of Latin America. Obviously given the lockdowns that we saw in Asia in 2021 and subsequently having an impact in the first quarter that impacted most of our global toothbrush business around the world more acutely here in the U.S. where we have taken decisions in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter to ensure that we accelerated migration of those toothbrushes when supply came back online back into refill inventories and improve on-shelf ability. So we had issues there particularly for North America where we are having to bring product in expediently in order to fulfill demand. That impacted some of our sourcing â€“ some of our toothbrush business likewise in Latin America likewise in Europe but it was more acutely faced by the North America business and we addressed that. Our toothpaste business historically has been a balance of a global supply chain that works very very efficiently. Given some of the challenges that we had in the North America we were bringing more product out of Mexico they were fulfilling increased demand for our product. It came into additional costs. Obviously as we talked about earlier that freight rates out of Mexico increased. We did have some delays getting product across the border at times but that was not a function of our problem. It was a function of what was happening systemically across the marketplace. So our toothpaste supply chain is global. It has been a competitive advantage for us for years and years. We are able to now transfer products from one market to another quite consistently and quite efficiently. But as you have delays in one market or supplier implications in one market it obviously creates a little bit of a bottleneck for you. We have taken decisions to ensure that we are having locations that are efficiently sourcing local markets where needed. And I think today we are in a much better position than we have been in the past related to dealing with the uncertainty of the supply chain network that exists in the world that we live in today. So overall we think we are in a good place. On volumes for Latin America listen the only real shortfall in volumes for us in Latin America was Brazil. We took high-double digit pricing 15% pricing in that market. We saw volumes come off a little bit which historically has been consistent with where we have seen. We have taken significant pricing. Mexico had positive pricing positive volumes across the board. So I would really attribute it to some of the softness we saw in Brazil because the rest of the business is okay and we will see how Brazil unfolds. But this is quite consistent with what we have seen in the past when we have taken significant pricing.Yes. What happened in the first quarter obviously as we saw a little bit of delays in our pricing execution in Europe which I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks given some of the annual negotiations and ultimately how those unfolded. The good news is those are behind us as we exited the quarter and we will see that pricing fully reflected as we move into the second quarter. We were a little late in the U.S. arguably I think in terms of how we sell things but we did lead pricing in our core business ahead of competition. We have seen competition ultimately follow but we did lead in the U.S. So we felt like we got to have it pretty quickly but obviously the costs moved a little bit beyond what we expected. So coming back to gross margin we were kind of more in line with what we thought. We thought we would see most of the pricing come through in the back half of the quarter which would obviously deliver accelerated sequential gross margin through the balance of the year. That was the initial assumption. But obviously all things changed when the February-March â€“ mid-February March cost increases came through. We have now subsequently taken more pricing. We will be taking more pricing in developing part of the world as we move through the balance of the year. And we are also looking at obviously accelerated pricing particularly through re-launches in the developed part of the world as we move through the back half.Sure. Thanks Kevin. Listen I think we stated it upfront. What is uniquely different for us right now is obviously the significant move we have seen in fats and oils. And that is a significant part of our cost structure of our business in addition to things that have moved up quite significantly that historically have been quite benign relative to our cost of goods things like glycerin which have doubled in pricing. So fats and oils is the big driver here. We are assuming that those costs will stay at the current levels and slightly increase through the balance of the year. I donâ€™t know how others have assumed that. As a result we have seen â€“ we have taken oil more or less at current levels with a slight increase through the balance of the year. That may be a different assumption than others have taken. And we obviously have the logistics on cost given our short-term implications of our global supply chain which we ultimately think as we move into 2023 will move behind us. So thatâ€™s predominantly the biggest difference. We have very strong brands that allow us to take pricing. You have seen that consistently year-in year-out our ability to take pricing particularly in the developing part of the world and we will continue to execute against that but we will watch the consumer environment very carefully. We are maintaining our investments in the business. Thatâ€™s very important for us to continue to accelerate the top line growth. Thatâ€™s hence why we feel good about the 4% to 6% organic given that we will be maintaining our investments in that piece. So itâ€™s really that. Our logistics â€“ our overhead structure just to talk to that we have the global productivity initiative as you know that we have launched. We are accelerating the savings in that through the back half of this year. Our operating costs or just our direct overheads were actually down in the quarter which again we will get the leverage from that as we move and accelerate sales through the back half of the year. But the biggest difference is we are assuming a continued â€“ a very very costly inflationary environment through the balance of the year. We donâ€™t see that changing at this point. I am not sure the assumptions that others have made or whether they made any assumptions at this stage but we feel itâ€™s prudent for the business to create the visibility that you need that we are assuming those costs will continue to be at current levels or slightly above.Sure. Listen itâ€™s early days. We obviously took pricing very very quickly as I mentioned we saw volumes come off a little bit in the business. And it was quite frankly more in the personal. Our market shares in toothpaste are actually up 20 basis points in Brazil. So overall we have seen again coming back to the core strategy we have re-launched our Sorriso business which is performing very well in the market. We launched Colgate Total which is performing well in the market and you have heard us talk about MX. So market mix so market shares are actually up. We will see or we will watch that very closely but we feel pretty good about where we are but we have got pricing in the P&L. We anticipate that obviously competition will follow given our leadership position in the marketplace but that will be up for them to decide. But we feel good about where we are. And the volumes historically when we have taken pricing at these levels are more or less consistent in terms of the falloff that we would have expected.No. Thanks everyone. Let me again extend my appreciation to all Colgate people. Let me specifically call out our employees in the Ukraine who our thoughts and prayers are with you and we continue to support you and your health and your safety with all the possible opportunities that we can provide you. Thanks everyone. We will talk soon.,0.118580341,0.697653353,0.258969389
109,109,APD,Ghasemi:,Okay P.J..Sure. It's actually pretty straightforward. What happens is that we anticipate energy cost increases and the announced price increases. But energy prices have been going up significantly higher than our anticipation. Therefore we need to take a delayed action to increase prices to recover what has happened in the past. That is why there will be a delay in recovering the cost. We will take the action. But obviously from the time we take the action and invoice the customer until we get the money and all of that there is a delayed action. But fundamentally we can't increase prices every day. We do that every quarter. And what we anticipated for the first quarter of this year was significantly lower than what actually happened. So now we have increased prices starting January 1 and we will increase prices starting April 1st and as we go with different customers and that is why there is a lag.Well the merchant business a lot of it is not a contract. The pass-through which is per contract is for our on-site business. That is pass-through. That hasn't affected our results and all of those pass-throughs have happened. That is why our results on our on-sites are very good. On the merchant side which in Europe is approximately 60% of our business that is where we executed the price increases. And over there most of the contracts do not have official pass-through it's a merchant business. Yes?Yeah.That is an excellent question. At this point in time we are doing carbon capture in order to produce green -- I mean blue hydrogen specifically. So I don't see us branching into that. But if that becomes a very attractive sector and we have the technology we take a look at it. But right now we are doing carbon capture those projects in conjunction with producing blue hydrogen.Thank you Steve.Jeff the thing is that everything obviously depends on your view of the world and in terms of what will happen. Look at this quarter we had high expectations for this quarter but then COVID came in and Europe got shut down. And energy price has been up significantly higher. I am not shy to say that I am very concerned about some of the geopolitical tensions what would be the implications of that for energy prices. Heavens forbid if anything happens we do train and so on but that's due to Europe energy. So as a result we are trying to be balanced and give people projections that we realistically believe we can meet. Now you can say we are conservative but we might not be. But we didn't see any reason at this point in time considering what has happened in the first quarter to change our guidance. Now if next quarter things change we will obviously share any thoughts that we have with you.Okay. Jeff I'll answer your first question and Melissa will answer your second question. The thing is that that corporate sector obviously from my point of view I'd like to see the number to be basically an EBITDA thing to be balanced. That means that we make enough money on the other parts of the business in order to balance our corporate overhead. That's our goal. But obviously because it is some of the sale of equipment it goes up and down quarter-by-quarter. But overall we would like to see that number to be just flat. Basically we don't make money we don't lose money. So with respect to your second question Melissa would you like to address that please?Okay Jeff.Well first of all good morning John. Hope all is well with you and I talked to you for one. With respect to the question that you're asking you always get it right. That is exactly what we're trying to do. That means that we are increasing the prices. And then hopefully as energy cost goes down we expect to keep some of those prices because to make up for the fact that we didn't get enough of it in the previous quarters. So you're right. If energy prices go down if they go down then we will have an upside. But that's a big if John. But that is exactly right. You have â€“ you are thinking about it exactly the way we are trying to execute.Well John that is an excellent question. First of all in my comments you're very smart you read through it I was saying that look at the projects that we are doing we think we can meet that target and exceed it. And therefore we are going to give you an update by midyear. So you're right. I mean we are doing a lot of good projects and that would help us. With respect to your second question it depends on how the contracts are structured John because countries will come to us have come to us and said I want you to do this project. It's co-gasification and you are not responsible for the CO2. I give you the raw material and you give me the product you adjust the total and the CO2 is my responsibility. If people are willing to do it like that as they have been then we do the project because then we are not adding any CO2 to the world somebody else is doing that. You see what I mean? But if it turns out that we are doing a project when the CO2 is our responsibility then we would think twice about doing anything. Sure because we are about reducing CO2 in the world not adding to it. But there are circumstances that the customers the country comes to us and said look I don't want to take the coal and make methanol out of it and I'll take the responsibility for the CO2. Okay John? Makes sense?Thank you.Good morning Chris. But the thing is that I gave you an update on Lu'An that the project is -- the plant is operating at full scale and all of that. And we had consciously given a break to the customer for two years for a lot of good reasons. And now we expect that to be going back to normal at the October of 2022. The other projects are being executed on plan. We don't expect any major issues with those. So up to now we are -- we don't have any significant disruption that we need to talk about.Well we have decided not to talk about those projects and there are a lot of them as you alluded to until we sign a final contract. So we don't want to announce MOUs or we don't want to announce every time that I have a video conference with the minister or anything like that. So those -- the opportunities are there. And when those contracts get to the stage that they are definitive contracts then we will obviously announce them but those projects are there. We haven't seen any slowdown.But they are delayed because of COVID in terms of getting to the final stage of the contract. But I expect that they do.Thank you Chris.Hey David. How are you?Very good very good.Yes. David I'm very glad that you asked the question. When we say the delay please it is not as if we are delayed in price increases. We are following -- let's say here is the month of end of April right? And our team gets together and say we anticipate that prices in June July and August the price of energy will go up 10%. Therefore we announce a 10% increase on prices on June 1 right? If the price during that quarter of June July and August goes up 20% then we have fallen behind. Then in the month -- the next quarter now we need to raise the prices 30% to catch up again. But then the energy prices -- but our issue in Europe has been that every time we anticipate price increases the actual price increases goes way beyond that. There was no way that we would have predicted no way that natural gas prices in Europe will go up 6 times. There was no way that we would have predicted that electricity cost in Europe will get to $0.20 a kilowatt. So that is the delay. It is not as if we are delayed in action. It is the fact that our anticipation of price increases were lower because we thought it was pretty robust but the real world got ahead of us. That is why we are lagging behind. We think that we will see a significant improvement in the performance of our business in Europe in the quarter we are in. I fully expect that. But who knows what happens with the energy price? That is our inability. That is where we are falling short in terms of ability to predict energy prices but nobody could do that because they have been so unprecedented that if at the beginning of last year you would have told somebody that electricity costs for Air Products will go from a few cents a 100 to $0.20 we would have thought that was unreasonable. But that's the way it has worked out. I hope I made myself clear David doing a lot of talking.Hi Kevin very good question. The thing is that there is a list of about 30 items in there and we can go through that with you off-line in terms of some of that. Some of that has got to do with the fact that we had some one-off benefits last year. So when you compare this year to last year those numbers look as if the costs have gone up significantly. But there is no question that the -- our underlying costs are higher because of all of the money that we are spending in the development of the projects that -- the mega projects. I mean each one of these projects takes $5 million $10 million to develop. As I said before we have added 3000 people to our organization in order to deal with that. Now as some of these projects become investment projects and approved by our board then some of these costs could go into capital rather than just being charged to the bottom line. But while a lot is going on they are charged to the bottom line. They are ongoing costs. So I don't expect the number to be as big as it is this quarter. But underlying we probably have $20 million $30 million a year of additional cost because of what we are doing with the mega projects.Well again thank you for the question Kevin. And we thought 8% is pretty robust. You're saying that your dividend is not growing as much as your EPS. But we obviously want to have some cash for growth. But there is another measure that we have talked about. This is not how we decide on dividend. We have a lot of factors into that. But overall we have always said that we want the dividend to be something between 2% to 2.5% of the stock price in terms of our dividend yield. So if you take $1.62 x 4 and divide it by the stock price we are at around 2.3% 2.4%. That's another measure. But as I said that's not the only way that we decide on EPS. There's a lot of factors in terms of cash flow and all of that. But that's -- and besides that we are way ahead of everybody else in our sector in terms of dividend. So we didn't want to overdo it Kevin.Thanks.Hi John.I don't think so John. I mean at the end of the day this is all a function of the competitive environment and the utilization of your facilities. In China right now our utilization of our merchant facilities is in mid-80s. So at mid-80s if power costs go up I think we will have the ability to pass that through.Well there is a lot of reason because we have a lot more people. We have 3 000 more people that we need to -- people say that okay you need to provide for these people and so on. But we don't have too many defined pension plans. But I'd like to see if Melissa has anything else to add to that. This is function of actuaries doing all the numbers how long people are going to live and all of that you know all of that. But Melissa do you have anything else to add?Sure.Thank you.Well for that to materialize we need to get COVID to go away so that the economic activity goes up. And then usually inflationary environment is a good thing for industrial gases usually but not always. But we think that if the inflationary environment continues and we are able to increase prices and then if the cycle turns and we keep some of those price increases that might be a positive. It's very difficult to quantify that right now.Yes. That's most of it yes.Thank you.Good morning Mike.Mike in my comments I tried to shed some light into that by saying that first of all the impact there was an impact but it was not material in the first quarter. The impact was a lot more in the month of October than it turned out to be in the month of November and December. And it seems that the harshness with which the government was trying to implement that back in September October has subsided a little bit. And as a result we don't expect any material effect of that on our results in the next quarter.Well first of all when we did some of these projects we obviously have made provisions for possible inflation and all that. But at the end of the day it is a fact that some of the costs are going up. In terms of how much of it we can pass on to the on-site customers and so on is very much dependent on the details of the contract that we have negotiated with the specific customers. So I cannot make a general statement. But overall there is pressure on us to be very diligent to make sure that we stay on top of the cost for our projects and all of that and make sure that they don't eat into our returns as you alluded to.Thank you.Good morning Duffy.Well I â€“ to some extent you can calculate it in the sense that for the first quarter you have two months of Jazan. So for the next quarter you have three months of Jazan. And most of that cost is Jazan. So you can kind of triangulate that approximately to come up with the number you are looking for.I expect that number to be pretty stable because it's basically a facility too. I don't expect that to change significantly and our maintenance cost shouldn't change that significantly.Thank you.Hey good morning.We will try for sure.I have no idea because it depends on what gets allocated how much of that will be for hydrogen where the locations will be what would be the criteria? I mean we are -- these projects as you know there's sometimes a lot of strings attached that some of it might not be acceptable to us and all of that. So it is very very difficult to project at this stage because they have just started. They obviously are engaged with the Department of Energy because we have some real hydrogen projects. It's not theoretical. But I have really no visibility into what that number could be or should be.Something in the order of magnitude of about 5% something like that. Dr. Serhan do you want to add to that?Thank you.Hi.Sure. I mean there is two pipelines. Obviously we go through all of this thing before we give you guidance. And because of what you said that's why we didn't change our guidance for the year. But number one you know the results for the first quarter. We have given you guidance for the second quarter so you can add it up and you get to what we expect to make in the first half. Usually from a seasonality point of view approximately if you take all of the years we make about 47% 48% of our profit during the first half and 52% to 53% of it during the second half. So that is the seasonality kind of a thing that you can take a look at. And then the other thing is that we do expect that we will get ahead of this energy cost in Europe a little bit and therefore recover some of that. And therefore the performance of our European sector will be better. And when you look at this quarter actually the performance of our business in Asia and in the United States were very good. It's just that Europe that hit our results. So if you put the combination of the seasonality and the recovery in Europe then we have a reasonable chance of doing the guidance that we have given you.Well thank you very much.Nothing that substantial because over there those customers on our on-site business are obviously paying for the higher energy costs. So we are not receiving any special compensation or anything like that. They're just paying for the additional energy cost and we get our fee at our contract.Thank you.Well thank you very much everybody for participating in our call. We appreciate your attention and your good questions. And we wish you good health and success for the balance of the quarter and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you again.,0.002972841,0.003978908,0.000415427
110,110,BX,Gray:,Sure. So what I would say on retail is we really entered this space as you know much earlier than others. And having a first-mover advantage is really important. I also would say the brand which I think is sometimes hard financially to analyze the value and power of the brand but in a channel like this the Blackstone brand means a lot. So what we did was design products. Weâ€™ve been selling drawdown funds into this channel for a long time. But in the last 5 years plus we moved to these perpetual products that provided 1099s on the tax front greater yield greater liquidity and we brought the cost down pretty significantly. People havenâ€™t really focused much on that. But retail customers generally when they were exposed to alternatives were charged much much higher than institutional clients. And it generally ended up with the investors taking too much risk to get over what they were charging and the outcome was poor for investors. And we really changed that bring Blackstone quality and institutional sort of pricing to individual customers and create products that work. And what thatâ€™s led to is really great performance. In the case of the individual products we have and weâ€™ve gotten on the shelf. And I would point out unlike the institutional market where there can be thousands of private equity managers itâ€™s more challenging for our distribution partners. They really want to work with two or three different products in this segment and we expect to be on the shelf for each of these. And that is all why I think today weâ€™re running at about 10x our nearest competitor in terms of monthly sales. So weâ€™re obviously operating in a different space today. We acknowledge we compete with some amazing firms. Weâ€™re sure they are going to come up with products. But if we continue to deliver given the strength of what weâ€™ve invested in our push globally by the end of the year we will have 300 dedicated people in private wealth. And the products that we can create given the scale of our platform I think there is more to do. We have just started with our European real estate platform. I think there are other spaces we could move into but it all starts and ends with performance. We have to create products that work. If we do that we can deliver for these customers. And I would just say overall this is an $80 trillion market that I think is 1% penetrated in alts today. It feels to us like a very large market and we are in a unique position today to capitalize on that.The only thing I would add to that is as we raise more of those they almost â€“ itâ€™s like a layering of a cake. So you will see more and more of those institutional ones coming along in each quarter. Itâ€™s probably going to be a little trickier to model as we build more and more of these products over time. So in the retail area I think this is a pretty substantive change we have made that allow for BREIT to be paid quarterly.On the private equity side what I would say is we are not ready to comment on that publicly. Itâ€™s obviously an area where investors would like more exposure individual investors. I think the idea if you did something would be to create something broad-based that included the whole range of sort of private equity P E including secondaries more structured equity growth and having a really broad platform I think would be helpful. But at this point we donâ€™t have anything to say. Hopefully in the future over this year we will have something to talk about.Thanks Brian.You are right. In your question Adam what we are seeing is LPs who want to stick with managers but maybe over their allocation targets because of strong performance in private equity saying I am going to sell some of my older vintage private equity funds and we have seen an acceleration of deal flow in the secondaries market which is why having a large fund for Vern Perry and our team in secondaries is very important. We like the space because as alternatives grow the need for liquidity grows. And itâ€™s a difficult business to invest in. You need a lot of knowledge particularly once you move beyond the 10 or 20 largest funds. And so we think the dynamic for investors is quite favorable. In terms of the mix of GP/LP-led clearly now there are more GP-led deals than there were in the past. We expect that to continue. We have raised and are in the process of raising a small GP-led fund that will co-invest with our main secondaries private equity fund. And we think thatâ€™s an interesting area as well. And so I think itâ€™s again one of the great strengths of our firm that in an environment where there may be some headwinds around private equity fundraising it benefits another part of our firm our secondaries business which has again delivered really great performance over time because of the structural inefficiencies in the market. So this is a business unit that I think has a lot of growth potential for us.What I would say on this is we are an investment manager. And when I look at the regulatory framework being a third-party investment manager there is a long history of that in the insurance business. If you look at large firms like BlackRock PIMCO Goldman Sachs they manage enormous amounts of capital for insurance companies. And I donâ€™t foresee regulators requiring that they essentially make investments in order to be investment managers. So from our standpoint as a third-party investment manager we think the relationship is sound. In some cases we do have minority investments here. But we think the framework that has worked over a long time for insurance company third-party managers should work going forward. And so I donâ€™t really see â€“ and by the way I would not envision a world just a short answer on us becoming balance sheet-heavy and taking on hundreds of billions of insurance liabilities. Thatâ€™s not something we would be willing to do.Today I would say itâ€™s about 80% of our business. We have got a real estate secondaries business. We have an infrastructure secondaries business. I think both of those areas have the opportunity to grow over time. There are sectors that are tougher credit because you donâ€™t end up having longer duration vintages. But you could see in areas like growth more of this continuation activity grow over time. But the main event today is primarily in private equity and I donâ€™t really envision that changing. But these other areas will grow I think as well as those markets grow.And the second question was on pricing pressure. I would say the short answer is particularly on our established products no we donâ€™t. Where we have gotten to how we are delivering for financial advisors and their clients is greatly valued. Itâ€™s possible over time in newer products there will be a little more competition. But I think this again is the power of the Blackstone brand something that I think I would just emphasize is underestimated. And it allows us to do things to be a capital-light manager and insurance to access the retail channel in a very cost-efficient way. The fact that the world wants to invest with Blackstone products is very helpful for us. And I think itâ€™s a powerful reason why you see us growing at this very rapid rate.So we have grown our direct lending capabilities quite a bit in the last couple of years as BCRED has grown. We also have BXSL a public BDC that has â€“ is a source of capital. We have certainly moved beyond middle market. I think in the quarter we committed as part of groups to seven deals that were $1 billion or more direct lending. The greatest area for strength for us is in some of the good neighborhoods we really like some of the faster-growing technology companies who have a lot of enterprise value but maybe not as much trailing EBITDA. And so we can use our capabilities of underwriting companies and get comfortable lending given the strength of an enterprise software business. I also think the current market plays well to direct lending platforms. When markets become more volatile financial institutions who are really important but because they are in the moving business they need to give the borrowers off and say â€œHey look I need a lot of flex pricing because I donâ€™t know where the market is today.â€ As a direct lender you can offer certainty to a borrower. And in an environment like that it becomes really important. So I do think you will see us continue to write larger and larger checks. And I think BCRED offer something very valuable to the borrowers and something very compelling to the investors which is why we think this momentum will continue.,0.003318697,0.004498899,0.000729573
111,111,CDNS,Au:,Hi John. Hi Anirudh. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah. Some double click on verification and China. Did you see any of the strength in these areas was maybe due to customers trying to buy ahead of any price increases or perceived inflation just given the whole term macro backdrop?Got it. Got it John. Maybe just one more for you. Nice raise to the operating margin for the full year. Where you look at first half margin if my math is right itâ€™s around 40% 41% range. The guidance suggests operating margins with a little bit lower in the second half. Can you remind us on whatâ€™s mainly driving the mix shift? Is it mainly due to timing of investments or maybe hiring thatâ€™s more backend loaded?Got it. Got it. Thank you. Thatâ€™s super helpful.,0.002451718,0.002451718,0
112,112,HCA,Hazen:,So from a competitive standpoint I mean obviously our wage programs have to be competitive. And that means different things in different circumstances. And we have made adjustments to our compensation programs really starting back in the third quarter of '21 to respond to some of the market dynamics. We continue to be very fluid in that particular area of our business in responding to the different circumstances from one market to the other. I would say that we think we're in a pretty good spot. We haven't seen any unusual maneuvers broadly. We are fortunate again to have competitors that tend to be only local and in 1 market or 2 markets at the most. So we don't see sort of patterns that permeate all 43 markets for HCA Healthcare. And so that's a positive on that front. But we haven't seen anything unique yet from the competitive landscape with contract labor and so forth. But I've got to believe that they are facing many of the same challenges as we do. And I believe over time we've been able to use our operating discipline use our systems use the learnings that we have across the company to create advantage for us. And I believe we will continue to do that.So February and March which were obviously months post Omicron surge behaved similarly to the holiday surge that occurred at the end of 2020 and on into the first part of 2021. Again we had solid non-COVID admission growth in February and March as Bill alluded to in the mid-single digits. So we're encouraged by that. There's nothing to suggest that the patterns will be different. But again we're learning obviously as we go through these patterns and we're hopeful that we won't have any more surges and we'll be able to judge some of these patterns more effectively. With respect to our payer contracts we're about 50% contracted for 2023 and about 30% contracted for 2024. Again those capacities in each of those years give us opportunities to adjust some of the inflationary expectations to the realities that we have today.I don't know Bill if we -- if I have the split right in front of me to be able to answer the first question but let me speak to the second question. We can get back to you on that first question with a little bit more specificity if we can. It's still early for us with the Galen College of Nursing programs and expansions. But just looking at some of the new schools that we've opened Austin Texas Nashville Tennessee parts of South Carolina the enrollment in a couple of those situations is record level enrollment in nursing program in the Galen College of Nursing. So we've seen a really robust initial enrollment. That gives us confidence. We also believe that we have an opportunity to integrate those students into our organization to support current needs as well as hopefully create synergy as they graduate the program and want to come to work for HCA Healthcare. So we're really encouraged by the prospects. But again that's more intermediate run kind of a gain although there will be some short run with nurse externs and rotations and so forth that we can utilize hopefully effectively to support current day needs. But the initial enrollment in a number of these new schools would suggest that there's still a reasonable supply of students who want to go into nursing schools. Maybe circle back to -- I guess -- I think you'll have an answer to your second question.No no we're not.Well I was going to say we believe we are compliant with the CMS rules which are tremendously complex and in many ways difficult to implement because of the variations that exist from one commercial contract to another and from one market to another. So we have through our -- an internal process established a program that we believe and CMS has validated in certain circumstances is compliant. And we continue to try to refine those presentations in ways that again satisfied CMS' evolving interpretation as well as our ability to adjust some of our postings to meet the evolving requirements.,0.006024003,0.006387055,0.000363052
113,113,TGT,Fiddelke,: Yes. Thanks for the question Chris. We still got some inventory to work through. And so you saw some of that pain in Q1 and our gross margin guidance of Q2 of operating -- or sorry our operating margin guidance of a 5.3% give or take a wide range around that contemplates the work we still think we have to do on the inventory side in the second quarter. Importantly we believe taking those actions in Q1 and Q2 set us up well for the balance of the year. We've got some big important seasons in front of us: back to school back to college. There will be a holiday before we know it. And so we're taking the right actions now to preserve a guest experience that continues to be strong. You saw it in traffic in Q1. And we're excited about what we see as a start of Q2 on the top line as well.: Yes. You hit on two of the bigger factors that will be at play in the back half of the year. As we've discussed we see about a billion dollars of freight and transportation pressure outside of what we would describe even at the start of Q1. But we do expect and we continue to take product in early intentionally to protect against supply chain disruption we expect to see some offset as we don't anniversary the same level of airfreight that we saw in the back half of the year. When it comes to mix I mentioned in my remarks about a 10 basis point drag from margin rate mix. The biggest shift from a category perspective is just the change in some of the categories at the top of the guestsâ€™ shopping list. And some of those categories where we've got some inventory to work through are the ones we'll work through in the first half of the year and we'll be better positioned heading into the second half.: You hit the nail on the head in your question. The sustainability of scale benefits especially as you've seen in SG&A leverage that should be sticky and we would expect it to be sticky. We've got some work to do on the margin line and Q1 and Q2 outlook reflects that. But as we work through some of that inventory liability as we let the levers we have to pull react to the current environment so Brian's note some of that snuck up on us in the first quarter and we'll work through some of that over time but we continue to have a lot of confidence that the long-term run rate of profitability for the business is in the 8% range give or take and it's our work to do the -- hard work to get back to that path.: Sure. Thanks for the question Kate. As we shared in remarks the headline story for us is traffic growth. But if you -- as you decompose ticket we did see a low single digit increase in ASPs offset by a reduction in units per basket. As you've heard us probably say many times before a lot goes into that ASP number. It's a little bit product mix. It's a little bit how much inflation is in the environment. And so a little trickier to decompose there but that's just a little more color on what we saw in the basket. We continue to be laser-focused on that traffic number. That's a great indicator for us of how -- what we're doing is resonating with the guests and to continue growing the top line by growing and deepening engagement with Target. That positions us well for the back part of the year. And that positions us to have the top line that we want as we rightsize the profit picture over time.: Yes. There's -- I mean obviously there's a lot of factors at play as we look at Q2 and the balance of the year. I think we used the language we wouldn't expect it to be normal for the balance of this year. So our best view of those factors is in our Q2 guide of 5.3% plus or minus a wide range around that and in our guide of 6% for the year.: Yes. You're certainly pointing in the right direction there Joe. We've given the kind of explicit expectations for Q2. But implied in the full year is an improving profitability picture that will come through margin in the balance of the year. To focus on the annual in the long run there is a theme that I've come back to over and over. Quarterly margin is going to have more volatility than one might think. But in the long run we're pleased with what we see as the potential of the profitability of the business. And we'll be on a path in the back half of this year to take steps in that direction for sure.: Yes Ed. The -- it's a good question. There's a few things going on if you look at the level of inventory on our balance sheet. One is we've got some categories where we need to work through some inventories. We've already talked about that piece. There's a little bit of product cost inflation sitting in that number too. But I will say given our desire to make sure we're landing some product earlier and protect against supply chain volatility for the near term here you should expect kind of that new normal of sales growth to inventory growth to include some working capital investments as we land some of that product sooner to make sure we've got it for the guest. And so those are the 3 big factors that we're watching. Obviously the first of those factors we'll to make some progress on here in the second quarter to get us in line with what we expect sales trends to look like for the back part of the year. But old normal might not be the current run rate in the near term as we work to secure product land it early and avoid some of the disruptions that have caused out of stocks over the last year.: We feel good about the gross margin performance in grocery. And just Food & Beverage in general has been such a steady top line grower share gainer quarter after quarter. And so the strength that we've built in that category I think makes the economics in Food & Beverage work in the right direction. We've talked a lot and I think it's important as we think about consumer looking for value the strength of the own brands in Food & Beverage good and gather and favorite day and the guest response we've seen to those 2 owned brands has just been incredible. And that's great from a guest preference perspective. It's also good for margin.: Yes. We're obviously looking at that across all categories and making sure that we're providing great value to our guests in spite of those inflationary cost pressures no different approach in food and beverage where we're looking to get that balance right there too.: So it's always a little bit of a mix of both when we're doing our job right? But the thing that we come back to when it comes to driving traffic is just driving deeper and deeper engagement. And you've heard us talk in the past with over 100 million Target circle guests. That's just one more way that we can continue to drive preference in a personalized way and build deeper and deeper engagement with Target over time. And you can see that coming through in the traffic results we see not just in this quarter but over the past couple of years. And that gives us a lot of optimism that what we're doing is resonating with the guests and that should bode well for the balance of the year and beyond.,0.00328441,0.004050732,0.000541216
114,114,ICE,Tyrrell,: And this is Joe Tyrrell. Iâ€™ll talk a little bit about the revenue synergies and the opportunities that this combination provides to us. So Warren talked about the opportunity to â€“ through these combined entities to accelerate our penetration of the original $10 billion TAM. That comes to us because of the highly complementary products sets we have available and actually the opportunity to cross sell products into both bases. So for example we're able to take ICE Products Solutions like our consumer engagement suite that has lead management and lead distribution capabilities as well as our point of sale system. Also our underwriting automation tools that are getting a lot of adoption as Warren mentioned earlier. Even Chase is now deploying our analyzer solutions I mean to their system as well as our market leading eRecording capability. So those are all opportunities that we can sell existing ICE Solutions into the Black Knight base. We can also take Black Knight products and sell them into the ICE space. So obviously servicing and I'll talk about the trend that we're seeing with lenders starting to retain more servicing in just a moment but also the secondary marketing technology things like hedging and loan trading platform that they provide. We also now will have the opportunity to recognize. I think of this as more of an MSRP versus some of the transactional fees that we've been able to generate on our network. Black Knight products are actually available today on our network. One of the things that our network does at ICE is it really enabled access to choice for lenders and so we've had a long standing relationship with many Black Knight Solutions being available. Weâ€™ll now have the opportunity to realize kind of the list price for those fees instead of just the transactional components that we've had. And then â€“ so thatâ€™s true for things like tax service property valuations and obviously Optimal Blue's been on platform for many many years. We also now have the opportunity to really expand how we've been thinking about data. Historically our data TAM has really been focused on selling data within the mortgage industry. Now as we look at these highly complementary datasets it gives us the opportunity to think about licensing this data. So we just recently released our first kind of true data product using the mortgage data that had come from Ellie Mae through our Rate Lock Indices and we've announced that we intend to put a Futures contract against that. As we're able to compliment all of that origination data with the secondary marketing data that we get from Black Knight coupled with the servicing and loan performance data we now have a really unique data set that as Jeff mentioned is going to provide a completely different level of transparency and visibility into how the secondary market thinks about pricing our mortgage backed securities and certainly modeling out prepayment. This also provides us the opportunity to enter new TAMs. So obviously servicing as Ben talked about is a $2 billion TAM that we now have access to that previously weâ€™ve had no offerings and didn't include in our current TAM. What we're seeing there in the servicing side is more lenders as Jeff mentioned are retaining the servicing rights. But what they've really lacked is the ability to connect everything from the point of thought of engaging a consumer through the loan manufacturing process into servicing and keeping that as almost a closed loop ecosystem where they are constantly monitoring loans to identify opportunities to help consumers improve cash flow by getting out of some of those risk adjustment that were put in place at the time of origination by monitoring things like home value appreciation or changes in the economic situation of those consumers where now those lenders can proactively go out and help them improve their cash flow which ultimately lowers default rates for consumers but enables those lenders to recapture that that consumer without incurring that acquisition cost. Also it gives us the opportunity to enter into a realtor TAM and that data is really interesting too us especially on the multiple listing service side. And so think about the opportunities of now combining data from consumer behavior to home listings all the way through the loan performance. In the data TAM we see that as that unique opportunity from a licensing perspective which we believe increases our previous data TAM by another $2 billion. And then lastly I would just say that this really helps us to accelerate our shift that we've already been engaging on to more of a recurring revenue a focus versus the transactional. As interest rates rise what happens in the servicing business is those loans stick in the servicing longer. So you have a more consistent recurring revenue base in servicing whenever interest rates increase. Now as interest rates decrease weâ€™ll be able to capitalize on the monetization opportunities in the origination side. So it really gives us now this end-to-end somewhat counter cyclical recurring revenue stream.: Chris so this is Joe. I'll give you the answers there. When we think about the customer bases again if you go back to Benâ€™s comment regarding explaining the differences between Encompass and Empower these two solutions really now give us the opportunity to address any technology philosophy that a lender might have. So if someone wants really a single tenancy highly customized solution we will have an offering there. If they want a more kind of commercial highly configurable but multi-tenant solution weâ€™ll have an offering there. So because these products are so complementary we believe it gives us an opportunity to really accelerate that penetration of the current TAM. There obviously are some customers that we have in common because within ICE there is so many different products that we offer but what we really see is the cross sell opportunity into these two bases. So even where we might have a similar customer perhaps it's a customer thatâ€™s using Encompass and also sing MSP the servicing platform there is still so many other solutions we now have available jointly that we can cross sell to that individual lender. If you go back and look at slide nine this is a high level view of kind of solution sets but within these sets there's multiple products and so there's so many different ways to monetize a single loan that goes through this entire work-flow and we're really excited about the opportunities we have of looking at our combined solution sets and being able to now make sure that we can provide efficiency that literally every step of this manufacturing and servicing workflow. And then you know lastly the data is a huge opportunity for us. Very complementary datasets between what we have on the front end and what Black Knight offers on the backend and for us we think it's really just kind of tip of the spear when we think about how we can monetize that data.: Yeah on the competition it really has not changed. This transaction doesn't change that. Our competition continues to be proprietary systems legacy technologies that many lenders have had for a number of years. I think weâ€™ve â€“ Ben's probably mention on previous calls that weâ€™ve really started to see that get unblocked. That is a lot of those lenders are realizing. As you go back to what Jeff pointed out on slide 34 whether a lender does one loan or a thousand loans they have to navigate all of this highly regulatory compliance requirements. And so these lenders have realize that they've spent a significant amount of development dollars just maintaining legacy systems to remain compliant instead of really focusing on innovation. So we're engaged in a lot of great conversations with many of those lenders who've been using proprietary technology. This combination and these two offerings that we now have give us the opportunity to really be able to offer a solution for whatever technology philosophy those lenders have coming off of the proprietary technology. So that continues to be the area where weâ€™ll be chopping wood.,0.131724358,0.517742455,0.222867872
115,115,SHW,Morikis:,Yeah. Chris I appreciate that question and Iâ€™d tell you that our confidence level is very high. We can always speak to our strategy. And I will tell you that we are blessed with a control distribution model that serves us well. And we leverage this model and that includes a strong and very consistent brand strategy. We think that branding strategy and the consistency of it is equally important. We have an innovation program designed to develop segments specific product. So because we have a control model we are able to talk to each of these segments to understand what are the needs of these customers what are the challenges and we develop probably products that are specific for these segments. And we do the same with our services so that we have a very good understanding of what the needs are of these painting contractors and we build the services to help them make more money. And finally the reason I have probably the most confidence is our people. I believe we have the best people in the industry and I am not apologetic about making that claim. We hire around 1 400 to 1 500 college graduates a year to enter our Management Trainee Program and we recruit outstanding talent. We train and develop this talent and we retain this talent. These are the people that serve our customers. And for nearly 40 years we have been investing in this program. This training program is 40 years old. We now have thousands of graduates from our Management Training Program throughout the company. In just our TAG business as an example four of our five division Presidents were management trainees our Group President was a trainee and throughout the company we have over 26 Vice Presidents that were management trainees. And by the way one CEO that was a training. We think this is important. Our customers they are buying more than a gallon of paint that -- we tell our people constantly that companies donâ€™t compete people do. 70% of our field leaders are graduates of our Management Training Program and they provide the leadership and direction to our tenured organization they know what to do they know how to win. And I say tenure because over 7 000 of our employees are -- have greater than 20 years service. Thatâ€™s nearly 15% of our workforce has 20 years or more of paint experience. And these leaders created an environment where people win and they want to stay. One half of our rep force has over 10 years of service. Turnover of our customer facing reps and managers is still in single digits. In this environment still in single digits we are hanging out of the most important assets we have and thatâ€™s our people. Our people wake up every day they focus on two things paint and making painting contractor successful. So this specialty store format it works for painting contractors. We have always talked about avoiding complacency in our company. In fact we often say that complacency kills. We are working to get better every day. We were working to make our painting contractors better every day. But I will say this I do believe this will come down to our people versus others. We have a 40-year head start a lot of drive a lot of determination. We are not going to win by a little bit. I am looking forward to competing against any model.Thanks Chris.Well Iâ€™d say first we just talked a lot about people. Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s a third advantage. But Iâ€™d also say that if you look at the assets we have talked about that we have deployed the responsiveness that we have. And I will say this our Chief Procurement Officer Colin Davie and his team are working really well with our customers and I have learned to appreciate the demonstration of rewarding suppliers who have stepped up to serve us and the suppliers have been creative in responding to our needs. The assurance of supply to your point continues to be an important element in this market and once you have that supply I think we demonstrated in the month of March we had a record month in the companyâ€™s history of producing product. And so what Iâ€™d say is that itâ€™s not one thing. Itâ€™s the entire ecosystem. Itâ€™s everything we are doing. Everything that we bring and itâ€™s all focused and starts with one thing the customer. So we are looking through that lens we are working back and this large 156-year-old company is learning to be nimble and quick and respond. And so Iâ€™d say that if I am looking at it from the outside in I am looking at a lot of assets that are really positioned well to be able to respond to a high demand market.Well we are really excited to your point. We have got a lot of momentum in these businesses and thereâ€™s no expectation for less if thatâ€™s the question. We sit in this room this boardroom and we talk with our teams regularly about the competence that we have. And maybe I could walk through quickly if you would like each of these segments just to give you a little bit of color because there is a lot of strength but boy thereâ€™s so much opportunity. If you look at our packaging we had a strong double-digit growth in the quarter. In fact each of the last three quarters we have had record quarters in this business packaging sales with sales of around 30% per quarter for the last three. So if you look at this business the demand is very robust and food and beverage our non-BPA coatings continues to gain traction. Both we and our customers are investing in capacity expansions in anticipation of a strong demand year here in 2022 and beyond. So we are thrilled about that business. The differentiation that we have in the technology and the people we have it is just phenomenal. This is a nugget that came obviously with the Valspar acquisition as this coil. We had a double-digit growth quarter in coil. Thatâ€™s the fourth straight quarter we have had sales of double-digit growth here and double-digit in every region led here by extrusion and metal buildings. So we are excited about this business going forward. Our general industrial again double-digit growth in the first quarter. Thatâ€™s the fifth straight quarter with double-digit growth in GI. Every region was positive led by North America and our LatAm business transportation and general finishing were strongest here. Our auto refinish had double-digit growth. Miles driven here are below but nearing pre-pandemic levels and continue to leveraging our technology as a key here. We brought in some wonderful technology from Valspar that works terrifically with our Sherwin tech technology and we are growing share here pretty aggressively. And in industrial wood we had a high single-digit quarter. We have got very good momentum here furniture kitchen cabinetry cabinetry and flooring which obviously correlate to similar positive trends in new res construction. So we saw increases in all end markets most by double digits and clearly really pleased with packaging and coil but all of them were strong and by region North America our largest region grew the fastest and LatAm Asia and Europe right behind. So expectations of this team remain really strong. We got a terrific leader here as well. Karl Jorgenrud came to us from Valspar. Got a lot of division presidents beneath Karl that are really experienced as well. We talk a lot about our TAG organization and the retention of people and the importance of that in TAG. But the same stands true in PCG. Our average division presidents average 29 years between Sherwin-Williams and Valspar. And again when you look back we talked openly about this greatest infusion of talent when Valspar and Sherwin came together and we have been terrific in the retention of those people. Our turnover still and this is years after the integration is below 7%. And so on the architectural side I think if you look at the legacy Sherwin and the talent we had on the architectural side we are pretty -- we like to think we are pretty strong always could get better. They brought obviously some talent came in from the architectural side of Valspar. In fact our new Chief Operating Officer came through the architectural side of Valspar. But when I look at the PCG side and the benefits we have had on the talent thatâ€™s come in from Valspar and our ability to retain it yeah it gives us terrific confidence going forward. So fundamentals we have got great assets. We have got great technology. We have got great people. And we have great customers and we are going to leverage that for everything we get.Thanks Ghansham.Yeah. What we will say is that if we need to we will. Itâ€™s not a hesitation.I think we have you are right Greg. Good for you because I know you know our company well we have done that. And I think whatâ€™s different now is that we are a little bit further into the volatility portion of this cycle and we have been communicating to our customers with greater clarity about the volatility. So I donâ€™t know that we need to wait as we have had in the past because we have been communicating to the customers that our intent is to try to keep the price increase to a minimum. But with that we are not building a buffer to be able to absorb the volatility and if there is more volatility then we will need to be out quicker with additional price. So I think we would be moving quicker and to your point itâ€™s nothing we would prefer to do or enjoy doing. We have yet to get a thank you note from any of our customers for it. But if the need be we are going to do it we will do it quickly.Yeah. You bet.Yeah. John let me first go back to your question and the comment that we made earlier. What we were speaking to specifically there was suppliers not customers. And we do work with our suppliers mainly to bridge gaps to ensure that we have the product when we need it where we need it. Itâ€™s not our intent to do their jobs but we are in this together with them trying to work with them and as you would expect when that happens thereâ€™s a discussion about what it cost that goes along with the fact that we are going to do that. So right now and you know our company our focus is on taking care of the customer and the fact that we have got our fleet and it is a point of differentiation. We do leverage those and there are times when we are less efficient doing that. For example one of our largest customers on the Consumer Brand side was very adamant about a South to North recovery approach that was a little less efficient than we would have liked to have seen but important to our customers. And so we took that undertaking and served our customers in a way that allowed us to respond to their needs not what -- not which was most or least expensive to us and thatâ€™s our DNA. And so if itâ€™s to use our fleet of trucks to help in the pinch to be able to get raw materials to a plant or in some cases right now we are producing where we can get the raw materials and we are shipping it in some cases across the country to ensure that we have supply where we need it and if we were less efficient than what we would like and we have this terrific footprint. We want to optimize our supply chain to its fullest. But when it comes down to it we are going to choose serving our customers. And over time that the efficiency will work its way back in we are not just waiting for that to happen. You should expect that as a leadership team we are very focused on it. Our teams understand that but we also understand that servicing our customers is the highest priority we have.Thanks John.Well Steve let me be very clear. We have incredible confidence in the second half hard stop. We are growing inventory sequentially each month of the first quarter because raw materials became more available. We added 50 million gallons of capacity. Itâ€™s online. Itâ€™s supporting the demand and we are building inventory. We donâ€™t have the inventory that we normally would have had coming out of the first quarter but given the additional capacity that we have we are able to serve our customers and we are going to utilize that additional capacity in everything we have between now and likely this time next year to run full speed all out building inventory to be able to continue to serve our customers. And if we have to put a little more in working capital to be able to serve our customers we are going to do that.Itâ€™s going to be a much stronger part of our success this year partially because of the comparisons that we have for sure. And second as I -- we have just talked the ability to make a record year -- a record month of production in March says that we have product we have raw materials. And so the demand is strong. We have raw materials. We have capacity. We are going to have a good time in the back half.Yeah. We are not going to comment about our customersâ€™ mix of business. I will tell you that itâ€™s overall a relatively small but is a very important and growing area. We have been talking for a number of quarters about the investments that we are making here the commitments that we are making here. In fact even the fact that we just came through a pretty challenging time and we were prioritizing that business with raw materials. I think it should speak volumes. We love this controlled distribution model through our own stores but we are very excited about this Pro who paints model. And we have through our own stores had if you look at it marginal success because there are customers that prefer a home centre channel. They want to be able to get in and they want to be able to buy a full array of products that are only available at a home centre. In the marketplace thereâ€™s been a limited amount of competition in this space for too long and we believe along with our strategic partners that thereâ€™s a terrific opportunity and we are determined to help our strategic partners win in this space.You bet.Well let me finish -- start with your finishing portion. We are going to be between 80 and 100 stores this year. And the answer as to why perhaps in a market like this to add stores is we believe in the model. And we play a long game here and we didnâ€™t predict that the world was coming to an end because we couldnâ€™t get the raw materials. We knew we would and we continue to invest in every aspect of our business. Including if you look at it in our manufacturing we invested in labor to have people in our facilities so that when raw materials became available we could convert them. We did that and I think Mark demonstrated that. So now you follow the pipeline a little bit further and you say okay now we are producing products. I am not going to be sitting here saying oh I wish we would have had the courage to invest in stores when things got a little bit tight. Maybe it comes with the 37 years of scar tissue that I have in the 30-plus years that all have and our other employee. We have seen this movie before. We know how it works. And we have got confidence. And when you have confidence you look at adversity in the eye and you say we are going to run right at this. And during these tough times we knew that others would do exactly what they do close stores close territories get in their bunker and we are going after. We are bunker hunting right now and we are going to continue to do that.Yeah. Four in the -- net four I think it was in the first quarter we would like to see a little bit more than that. But itâ€™s going to ramp up here between now and the end of the year. We will be in the 80 to 100 before the end of the year.Well as I mentioned earlier we have a model that we believe is the right model in the market. It certainly is for us. We believe painting contractors thrive in a specialty store format with the -- with people behind the counter that have 10 years 20 years and 30 years of experience with products that were built for them in their specific areas and services that are focused on making them as productive as possible and as profitable as possible. So I would just say we welcome with no arrogance the competition. Competition makes you better. I am going to bet really big on Sherwin.Yeah.Good morning Mike.Yeah. I want to give -- earlier I mentioned Colin Davie our CPO and also Heidi Petz our Chief Operating Officer. I want to give her credit as well and she started in her role on March 1 and I donâ€™t think she came up for air throughout the balance of the quarter out of this area. I mean terrific work by the entire team of really ensuring that we have the raw materials we need and importantly where we had it. When we look at whatâ€™s been happening I donâ€™t -- the impact on our architectural business outside of the U.S. is obviously a very small part of our business not significantly impacted by this. The confidence that we have by working with our suppliers and in a partnership way I think is why we have this confidence. And again the talent that we have in procurement and another fellow has to get the attention here. Joe Sladek our President of our Global Supply Chain is the one that takes all these products and quickly is turning those in to finished goods and getting them to our stores and to our customers in a very nimble and quick way. Itâ€™s amazing behind the scenes the things that are happening to be able to convert quickly and take advantage of these opportunities and we expect that to continue going forward.Yes.Yeah. David the price increase has been actually a little bit better than the price increases we went out with last year. So the effectiveness has been maintained and improved as the months have gone on has it been -- it has been filtered through the market and we feel very good about where that is at right now.Thanks David.Yeah. Kevin it absolutely is and we have great confidence in our ability to do that. I think you are going to continue to see that with volume. We have obviously seen the pickup in raw material cost has had an impact on it. So the price that has been announced rolls through. Thatâ€™s going to have an impact. We have also talked publicly about some of the other that are available to us that we are continuing to emphasize and attack. And some of that includes the simplification of our product lines our raw materials less complexity going through our plants. I want to be very clear in our confidence and our ability to reach those metrics that we have been talking about. We were gaining some ground on it unfortunately with the raw material spike. We gave up a little bit of ground in this but we have got -- this isnâ€™t just Bravado we are going to do it. We are going to take the -- we have got confidence we have got plans and we are executing on those. So we are going to deliver on this.Yeah. Itâ€™s a -- I think a great example of our M&A strategy which we have always said we are not trying to be everything to everyone everywhere and that we donâ€™t need practice. We are creating shareholder value. And so when you look at the opportunity to acquire a strong position and protection in Germany with local production Sherwin-Williams is strong in fire protection in the U.K. also with local production. And our ability to leverage the strength of each and production capabilities in each of the primary markets and drive new corrosion protection and fire protection sales together and then really connect the dot is a terrific opportunity for us. And I think itâ€™s a great example of our ability to identify assets work with owners and to really capture the best of both. The leadership team just as we have talked about with Valspar the leadership team of Sika has also joined us. Thomas Hasler [ph] is a very strong leader in the Sika business thatâ€™s joined and we believe that the combination of the legacy Sherwin and the new Sika assets and people is going to provide a great platform for growth.Yeah. You bet.Well I am sure that you are all getting tired talking about leadership. But I would say I am going to start here with we have got a terrific leader in our Group President Justin Benshere that has this team really positioned very well. So I am going to take your answer slightly differently than what you have asked and start with the fact that our team is positioned to be able to capture market share in any situation. So new residential slows down we are going to capture it on residential repaint and property maintenance or any other way that it tilts. That said given my comments earlier about just the shortage in new residential housing and the demand we expect that thereâ€™s going to be a strong demand and itâ€™s going to continue. The homebuilders that we are working with they have described this as a bump in the road here but they are driving through it. And I suspect that as demand continues thereâ€™s going to be more and more starts and we are going to be there. But if it does tilt another way we are okay. We are going to be right on top of whatever way itself.Well itâ€™s up and running. But to say is there more capacity to be captured. The answer is yes. Joe Sladek as I mentioned the Global Supply Chain President. He and his team are constantly working on debottlenecking and finding more capacity in every asset that we have. But the 50 million gallons that we spoke to is up and running I also mentioned the $300 million we are investing in Statesville in that facility to add additional capacity. That will be coming up I believe in 2024. It will be coming online. So we are looking ahead. We expect to continue to drive volume and we are ahead of the curve. Again speaking with the confidence and determination we have we are not going to look back and wish we would have and we have great determination and confidence in the execution of our strategy. We are going to have the capacity to be able to take care of it.I think what we have talked about for input costs yes we said the first quarter would probably be the highest inflation of the year second quarter we expect it to moderate and then come down a little bit further in the back half based on what we see now. As Al mentioned we have got the best visibility is maybe about a quarter or so. But yes thatâ€™s correct. Our current outlook shows moderation in the back half.Well I would say itâ€™s a very good question except that we have been witnessing this for some time now and itâ€™s only continued. And I would attribute it largely to more of a labor issue than availability. These paint contractors when you recognize that labor represents 80% to 85% sometimes 90% of their cost. If you can make that per man hour more productive you have more projects that you can complete less callbacks the opportunity cost issues resolve and so more and more people are moving up in quality. We have a full breadth -- we have the full breadth of products. And I would tell you even going back to when I was in a store. Rarely did you see people that would stay in that lower price. Typically what they -- what you would find is people that would be very price conscious would get in there and there are some applications for it. The ceilings of a closet or so okay I get that. But what you find is people quickly are learning -- they learn that I can spend a little bit more on a higher quality product and get more productivity better touch up get off the project with no callbacks and go on itâ€™s well worth it. When you look at the cost if itâ€™s a high cost market the per man hour expense itâ€™s not a big investment to pay a little bit more for a higher quality product and get on to the next project for sure. And our people are trained in that. They understand how to do that. And again it speaks to the tenure of our people. Again Justin and his team all our division presidents they -- this is a program. We donâ€™t just wait for this to happen. We donâ€™t open doors and hope people walk in. We donâ€™t hope that they just move up the food chain and quality by themselves. These are programs that we execute and itâ€™s working very well.You bet.Yeah. Eric as we said on that range we are trending towards the higher end of that low double-digit to mid-teens range. But we feel right now as I mentioned on my previous answer related to oil and propylene and some of the other things we are comfortable in that range right now. If it moves beyond that I think you have heard multiple times today we will be ready to react with more pricing as needed.Yeah. I might give you more of a description of what we are doing and what it looks like for obvious reasons. We will tell you about it after we have done it and show you the scoreboard on how we have achieved it. But I want to be very clear on Eric is that itâ€™s not through price. We bring solutions and we bring profitability to our customers and we do it in a way that people are willing to stay for. Earlier there was a question about we -- there was rumors about are we discounting to be able to do that and I want to be very clear and very direct that that is not the case. But what we are doing though is leveraging what I just spoke to the quality of people the products and services that we have [Technical Difficulty] booked. And they have a strong desire to complete as many projects as they can and protect their reputation. And so if you could imagine all the activities you would do if you were a store manager or a sales rep of Sherwin-Williams and building relationships building trust the connectivity and consistency is important. Every day over 3 000 sales reps wake up -- Sherwin-Williams reps determined to go be a better partner for their customers. And our ability to reengage with those customers and be responsive to their needs have the products they need anticipate what challenges they might have shifts in weather to project delays whatever it might be all aligned in helping us to reengage. And while we donâ€™t think we lost customers through these challenging times. We do feel as though we have lost some sales and we take great pride in our controlled model of anticipating what products they are going to need and having them there. But there were times where it may have gotten their late or we couldnâ€™t get it there when they needed it and they might have had to go somewhere else. Well you could rest assure of one thing here. We are not going to just assume they are coming back and so we are going to be very deliberate very active and engaged with these customers to ensure that they are back in our stores start with a cup of coffee make a friend use our paint. We are going to be after it pretty regularly.Well we are going to be converting these precious raw materials into finished goods and pursuing all segments of our business and so I think at this point thatâ€™s the extent that we want to talk about. We will talk about what we did next quarter but we see a terrific opportunity to utilize the capacity that we have.This was a challenging time. It did give us an opportunity to look at our SKUs and rationalize some of those down that will never return. There will be simplification opportunities in what we come out as a product line with. And I would suspect that what you will see in the very near future is a little bit of expansion beyond what we had coming through last year. But we are not going to just jump back to where we were. We are going to be a better company more efficient with our working capital. We will have the inventory we need but it may not be spread out as wide as it has in the past but we will have what our customers need.So Iâ€™d say this. You are right. If you look historically thereâ€™s been an opportunity there but thereâ€™s also been the opportunity to invest back in the business. And so I would answer your question this way our determination is to make our [Technical Difficulty] and help them make more money. There are other costs that go into this labor transportation all of these things that we are doing it might not necessarily hit the gross margin line but our investments that we invest in to help our customers in their profitability. So Iâ€™d say that each one of these we take a very in-depth view and very thoughtful view in how we can continue to ensure that what happens as a result of all these investments all the pricing everything that goes into it is that our customers win and when they win we win. And if for whatever reason we got piggish and tried to put pricing in that didnâ€™t help our customers to achieve their goals and be more profitable then we donâ€™t deserve that business and you are not going to see us do that. And so our investments our commitments and the ability to help customers be successful will be the drivers.Well Iâ€™d say we are well ahead I think as the leverage of talent is number one. I mentioned starting at the top with our new COO Heidi Petz all the way through to Group President and Performance Coatings and throughout the company Iâ€™d say thereâ€™s a terrific infusion of talent. Iâ€™d say the assets and the technology and the leveraging of the customers has been exciting. I mentioned earlier automotive the combination of some technology there is -- I was with one of our larger automotive refinish customers who asked if thatâ€™s why we bought auto -- or bought Valspar for the automotive finish it was that good. So Iâ€™d say there are terrific opportunities there. The brand itself is a very strong brand and growing in relevance and importance. And I think thatâ€™s terrific opportunity and one that I think were to add. Iâ€™d say if I look back and say what we could have done differently or faster or better. I do think that coming out of 2016 when there was some hesitation on the previous leadership of Valspar to put pricing in. It took us years to recover that. And I think we learned from that and I think itâ€™s a big part of why you see the determination always I hear -- I hope you hear the determination that we have not to allow that happen. And part of that is so that we can remain healthy and serve our customers so we can continue to invest in our business. I think the working capital is another area. I think we have gotten to it. I think thereâ€™s still more opportunities as are the asset utilization of the plants. So we are proud of what we have accomplished there. But I would tell you just as we mentioned earlier complacency kills we are not done. Thereâ€™s still plenty of opportunities and we find ourselves still prioritizing and that speaks to I think the quality of the company that we acquired and the quality of the people that came along with it. But we are just getting started. Thereâ€™s still a lot of work to be done there.Thank you.,0.268975393,0.976173937,0.395658269
116,116,ORLY,Johnson:,39:20 Thank you.39:40 Good morning Brian.40:28 Yes Brian. This is Greg. I'll take that one. And then see if Brad or Tom has anything to add. I don't look at price point specifically to driving consumers' driving habits. Gas prices definitely are going to impact miles driven over time. Unfortunately miles driven data as you guys know lingers for a couple of months and we don't have data for the past few weeks. But what we believe is if gas prices ramp up incrementally over time especially the DIY consumer who is typically more economically challenged will adapt to that and budget for it. 41:13 When you see spikes in fuel prices like we saw late February early March often that will have more of an impact on miles driven and impact our business a little differently but that's a short-term impact. I mean over time those customers and consumers will have to budget a different portion of their income for fuel because they got to drive to work they got to drive their vehicles. 41:39 One of the things that's a little different this quarter than what we've historically talked about fuel prices is we're in an inflationary environment. And a lot of things are moving from a cost perspective right now but at the same time we're all experiencing wage inflation. So as fuel prices have increased wages have increased as well. And we're optimistic that that's offsetting some of the pressure that fuel prices would've put on miles driven. Do you guys have anything to add Tom or --43:36 Yes Brian. We're watching that really closely we look at our product in a good better best category mix and we have not seen evidence thus far of any trade down or any significant trade down. What we have seen is more of a supply chain issue than a pricing issue where some of our customers have been willing to trade from branded to proprietary or proprietary to branded or up and down the value spectrum as needed. When we don't have maybe exactly the brand of oil they want in stock at that time they'll trade across brands or trade up and down. But from a price inflation standpoint we've seen no evidence of consumers trading down.44:39 Good morning Bret.44:55 Sure. So we're slow to announce some things and we wanted to wait until the DC was underway and contracts were signed and everything before we talked about that publicly Bret. But we are happy with our progress we're making in Mexico. We're opening stores albeit at a slow pace. Our strategy in Mexico is similar to our strategy here in the US. We want to make sure we've got the supply chain infrastructure in place before we really ramp up our store growth at a more aggressive pace because we want that customer experience to be what it's going to be long-term. And we want that service level from our DC for our professional customers to be at the very highest level from day one. 45:45 So we're growing the market incrementally. You won't see the O'Reilly brand down in Mexico right now. You'll still see MAYASA/ORMA. And that's part of our strategy. We'll transition that over time but the first step is to get the distribution center open. As Brad said that will happen in the first half of next year. And then we would plan to ramp up our growth -- our store count growth in Mexico and as we grow consider additional distribution centers at that time. As far as capacity one of our major competitors has over 600 stores down there and we feel like there is a pretty big opportunity to grow our store count somewhere in that range in Mexico as well.46:56 Yes Brad do you want to take that one?49:48 Yes. And Bret to add one more comment to that is our pricing team continues to do what they do day in and day out and that's monitor make sure we're competitive in all of our markets. And we talk about the price decreases we made on the professional side but keep in mind that's offset. We're looking for opportunities to increase prices as well as decrease our prices and our pricing team will continue on that effort.52:06 Thank you.52:44 Hey Brad do you want to take that?54:43 Yes. Simeon we remain bullish both on the industry and on our company performance. Our DIFM business has been strong and we expect it to be strong for the balance of the year. The uncertainty is around the DIY consumer. And we're still very optimistic there but there is just -- when you look at fuel prices and you look at some of the headwinds that we talked about in our prepared comments we just wanted to make sure that we acknowledged the risk for the balance of the year. But we're still bullish. We still feel good. There is a lot of positives that will impact our DIY consumer. They're driving their vehicles more miles they're keeping them longer there is a lack of new car inventory. So there's puts and takes in this but we're not trying to be negative. We're just trying to acknowledge that there are some headwinds potentially.55:38 Thank you.56:32 The DIY side of the business is much easier to monitor pricing in the industry. And we always have and always will continue to make sure we're competitive on that side of our business. So DIY side is ongoing price adjustments both up and down to ensure our competitiveness. On the DIFM side it's a little tougher. And we took a more aggressive approach on the DIFM side this year.57:12 That's correct.57:16 Thank you.57:27 Thank you Richard. We'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire O'Reilly team for your continued hard work delivering yet another solid quarter. I'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today and we look forward to reporting our second quarter results in July. Thank you.,0.002778172,0.003058016,0.000230763
117,117,HUM,Diamond:,Sure. Happy to take that. To your first point yes as you think about the raise relative to our performance for the first quarter First I would mention that consensus was lower than our internal estimates for the first quarter. So as we think about it internally we think about $1 of the outperformance is what we were looking at from an internal perspective. And you are correct you can think about that as roughly half attributed to lower administrative expenses and half attributed to the pharmacy outperformance. So as we thought about the year as you said and as I said we do expect that the pharmacy outperformance will continue although with some moderation. And so that will allow us to support the $0.50 raise as well as the dilution that weâ€™re currently estimating from a hospice divestiture later this year. On the administrative expenses as I mentioned some of that is timing. Some of that is a pull forward of savings we would have otherwise expected later in the year so not necessarily incrementally positive. We want to see how that continues to develop. And then we will also look to see if we continue to see some favorability that may allow for some additional investment in the distribution and marketing strategy that weâ€™ve talked to you about and may allow us to accelerate some of those investments again if we continue to see favorability but we are not taking any of that into the full year guide currently. On the MLR then I would say looking at the retail MLR in particular analyst ranges were quite wide as we looked at the models. And so the comparison to whatâ€™s reported this morning is heavily influenced by the few that actually responded to the survey. So I think thatâ€™s part of it. As I mentioned in my comments from an individual Medicare perspective I can tell you that the MLR came in as we expected. Per my commentary we did see positive utilization on the inpatient side due to COVID â€“ with COVID. While we saw higher absolute levels in January it declined more quickly than weâ€™ve seen historically than we would have expected. And non-COVID was not able to rebound as quickly as COVID declined. So that was certainly positive. Given the high level of COVID however and the higher rate of what we refer to is that incidental COVID where it wasnâ€™t the admitting condition but there is a COVID positivity diagnosis that translates to additional unit cost. So we did see higher unit costs as a result. As I mentioned we also considered the higher unit costs that we saw restated for fourth quarter and our first quarter estimates. And so as you think about that all in the first quarter results reflect inpatient pretty much in line with expectations. And then for non-inpatient just given how early in the year it is and the limited visibility we have those in the first quarter at expectations as well. We will continue to watch those things over the course of the year but feel good about the early indicators weâ€™re seeing and no source for concern about what weâ€™re anticipating for individual MA or retail MLRs.Sure Matthew. I can take that. And youâ€™re right. As you look at the first quarter and again youâ€™re looking at retail MERs versus individual MA. And so there are some differences in terms of the underlying product mix year-over-year particularly around Medicaid and some growth in DCE membership which has a higher MER than individual MA. Again I do want to reiterate that from an internal perspective as we look at the underlying businesses each are performing as we would expect. So no concerns there. In terms of one other difference I would highlight in terms of just the first quarter specifically is the change in prior period development year-over-year. With COVID there were a lot of changes in claim processing payment policy changes as a result of some of the stress that hospital systems were under. And so that significantly impacted prior period development. We anticipated a significant decline in prior year development year-over-year and that will disproportionately impact the first quarter results. Which is why in our earnings release we gave you the detail on what that would look like if you just stripped out PPD and the noise that that creates. Itâ€™s hard to tell whether some of the analysts fully understood or anticipated the magnitude of that change year-over-year. So those are really some of the main drivers. And again I just want to stress that we continue to feel comfortable with our expectation of a 50 basis point improvement in the individual MA margin as we said and believe weâ€™re on track to do that and know early concerns. The other thing to keep in mind is the dollar of COVID contingency you can assume thatâ€™s largely in the retail MER expectation. As we said in our commentary we continue to hold that conservatism within our guide. So if it proves unnecessary over the course of the year then that would benefit the retail MERs as well.Hi Kevin this is Susan. So in terms of your second question around the COVID headwinds we would say that we did not see a COVID headwind emerge in the first quarter. As I mentioned given the dynamics we saw with the utilization patterns the way we have thought about it is not just the absolute gross COVID impact but rather net of any offsetting reductions in non-COVID. And so as I mentioned while January saw higher COVID levels. And in fact we saw that was the highest level of COVID admissions in any given month since the start of the pandemic in February and March given the rate of decline and how much faster that was versus previous surges. We just didnâ€™t see non-COVID have the ability to rebound at the same pace. So â€“ and thatâ€™s true both across Medicare and commercial. So we would say that that was net positive. As we said in our fourth quarter commentary we do not â€“ we will be very cautious in releasing that dollar of contingency that we are holding just recognizing the longer COVID goes on we just donâ€™t want to assume that patterns will remain the same as we have seen historically. And then as I mentioned in my commentary just the rate of sort of COVID positivity itself while the public health emergency is in force we will drive additional unit costs for any admission that does happen to have a COVID positive diagnosis associated with it. So we will need to continue to watch that. In terms of MLRs with the exception of the PPD that I mentioned that will disproportionately impact the first quarter. I think if you normalize for that then I would say there is nothing sort of unique about this year that we would expect MERs to be to vary other than the fact that sequestration if you recall is still in play the way we were for the first quarter. It will reduce by half for the second quarter and then is assumed to be back in force for third and fourth quarter. So that will cause a little bit of seasonality differences year-over-year. But aside from that I canâ€™t think of anything else specifically that we would expect unless as I said the COVID â€“ depending on what happens with COVID which we have acknowledged could create some quarterly variations.Hey A.J. Sure. Happy to take that. The first question on labor challenges. I would say they are fairly widespread. There are certainly some markets where we have sufficient capacity and we are certainly doing everything we can to take advantage of growth opportunities there. But generally speaking some of the larger markets where there is more of an opportunity we continue to see challenges. I would say though they are â€“ I would say they are getting a little bit better primarily due to the fact that COVID has subsided. So some of the labor challenges are due to nurses having to quarantine as a result of COVID. And so as we see that come down to again the lowest levels we have seen. That certainly helps as we have more nurses available. As I mentioned in my commentary we are also pleased to see that we â€“ our initiatives are having some positive impact on recruiting nurses and retaining those nurses again creating some additional capacity. But I donâ€™t want to diminish the fact that it continues to be a challenge. We continue to watch sort of the wage environment and other sort of resources being used to recruit and retain nurses and we will try to make sure we stay contemporary with that. On the value-based model the way that works is One Home which is a company you might recall we acquired last year which currently provides home health DME and infusion services to our Florida and Texas members under a value-based model. That is the model that we are looking to expand. So One Home actually contracts with the health plan under a capitated arrangement for all of the spend for those three service categories. And then in markets where there are downstream risk providers they will then downstream sub-cap with those providers. But One Home is the one taking the full risk on those services. Whatâ€™s unique about that model is the way that it is structured is they act as a convener and provide some relief and administrative burden from referring providers where the referring provider can refer a patient in for the home health DME and infusion services and One Home will take responsibility for placing all of those services. In the absence of that model the referring provider has to discretely coordinate all of those services which can lead to some fragmentation and dislocation in the way carriers delivered. So with the One Home model they will take responsibility and where possible then they can refer that patient directly into Kindred or other high-quality home health providers in the market based on capacity and other things. And so that â€“ typically as we launch the market we will go in with a more broad network to avoid any sort of provider and patient friction at start. And as the providers get more comfortable and understand the model then we will look to then begin referring those patients into our high-quality providers in the market and certainly with Kindred top of mind. So thatâ€™s how it works. Happy to answer any other questions when we talk later today if you like.Sure Stephen. So yes so on the PYD we did see lower â€“ prior period most favorable was just lower than we had previously expected and really attributable to higher inpatient unit costs in the fourth quarter. There were two main drivers of that. One was higher non-COVID unit costs. They were quite high in the fourth quarter. Frankly there is still some work we are doing to understand why that is. And then also on the COVID admissions as we set reserves at year end we have the benefit of authorization data. And so we have really good data on the absolute level of admissions. From the utilization perspective claims of restated just as we would have expected. So the absolute level of admissions is consistent with what we thought. What we saw however is of those admissions we anticipated more restated as a COVID admission when on the initial authorization they did not reflect COVID as the reason for the admission. And so we would have contemplated those as non-COVID admissions. Given the significant difference in unit cost for COVID admission versus non-COVID that caused our December unit cost to restate higher. So I would say itâ€™s a little bit of a mixture with December specifically related to COVID and the previous months more reflective of increases in the non-COVID unit costs which we are still studying. Those are things again we want to see how those continue to play out. But for the first quarter estimates we have contemplated those higher unit costs. In terms of acuity I would say broadly we do not believe we are seeing an increase in acuity of the patients across any of our lines of business. There is no indicators of that so far. We think again when you are talking about the level of â€“ particularly in the fourth quarter of sort of COVID admissions to some degree this is a reflection of as you see that higher incidental COVID positivity rate as I mentioned the admissions that are then sort of left in the non-COVID bucket tend to be higher average unit costs and in this case just happened to restate higher than we had initially expected.Hi Ricky yes sure happy to answer that. So there were a couple of contributors to the pharmacy outperformance. One as you said was related to just some of the slightly favorable membership we saw across MAPD and PDP from an absolute perspective. And then as you mentioned and Bruce and I highlighted what we saw was that the members that were retained by the health plan through AEP had a higher use of Humana Pharmacy than members who disenrolled in AEP. And it was about a 9% difference. And that was a larger difference than we have seen historically. So it was not something we had specifically anticipated. And so that higher membership and that dynamic of retaining more members who are more likely to use Humana Pharmacy contributed to some of the volume outperformance. I would say there was additional volume outperformance even above that and we think thatâ€™s a reflection of the continued investments we are making in the pharmacy business to improve the service delivery model and experience overall. We implemented a number of initiatives over the course of 2021 designed to drive improved mailer penetration and use of the pharmacy business and saw success there. And we have seen further success in the first part of 2022 just beyond what we had originally anticipated. And as I mentioned we did anticipate higher mailer penetration in â€˜22 versus 2021 and we are just seeing that come in slightly higher even than we had expected which we view very positively. In addition we did see lower unit costs. That is a function of just the underlying drug mix and the negotiated rates. And so that is contributing as well. And then finally we also saw a favorable cost to fill. And so as a result of some of the investments and enhancements they are making in the service delivery model and Bruce referred to some of those investments. We are also seeing some positivity with reduced cost of fill than we expected. So all of those we view very favorably. And generally you can assume that those do continue although as I mentioned we do expect some moderation because our plan did contemplate continued increases in mail order penetration over the course of the year. And so as we described in the commentary you can think about our thinking on pharmacy is raising $0.50 now that reflects the outperformance and then also that outperformance allowing us to cover the potential dilution from a hospice divestiture assuming that we donâ€™t use the proceeds for share repurchase.Hey Josh. So yes so for your first question we would say that you should think about the â€˜22 baseline at the $24.50. Similar to how we talked about it in our initial guide we would just encourage you not to get ahead of us on the dollar of COVID contingency. As I mentioned there is still a lot to see in terms of how medical costs play out over the course of the year and utilization more broadly morbidity etcetera. So you can consider the baseline for now the $24.50 and we will continue to be transparent about what we are seeing. But certainly pleased with the ability this early to raise and get towards the higher end of our range and certainly hope that we can see continued progress but I would encourage you to consider the baseline for now the $24.50. In terms of hospice solution so as we have said for 2022 the pharmacy outperformance will allow us to cover any potential dilution. We are internally anticipating that the transaction would likely close third quarter. And so thatâ€™s what we are thinking about in terms of our current guide. As we have talked about this has been something that we have been planning and looking at options for some time. So from a 2023 perspective we have always been anticipating that we would divest a majority stake in hospice. And so that is contemplated and will be contemplated in our earnings progression in 2023 where we would expect to again see a return to higher levels of Medicare growth while also delivering within our targeted long-term range of 11% to 15% off of that $24.50 baseline despite the hospice divestiture. For the proceeds as I mentioned in my commentary. My preference would be to use as much as possible towards deleveraging just so we can get that down and give us some additional flexibility we mentioned in my commentary that we would expect to be at approximately 40% by year-end versus the 45% we reported for the first quarter. And so we do expect to use a majority for debt repayment.Yes exactly.Hey Scott. So yes so to your point so right now we will have to see obviously what the final rates come in at. But currently with what we have seen preliminarily they are lower than the overall average sort of rate increase in terms of the rate book. Most of our â€“ on the hospital contracting side I would say most of our contracts are tied to fee-for-service reimbursement. And so typically we would not see much â€“ whatever those rates come out with is what we would see. Itâ€™s not to say that we might not see some providers come and sort of want to talk to us. I would say they may want to talk to us about some other components of our contracts in terms of how we handle claims processing and audits and some other things but I would not anticipate that we would be opening contracts up to move off of the them being tied to the Medicare reimbursement rate. I think that there are some other service categories home health is one example where we tend to pay lower than Medicare fee-for-service rates. So depending on where those rates come in that could be an area where providers may come where they are being paid less than Medicare reimbursement and they may want to have a conversation on that in this inflationary environment. So we will continue to monitor it. I would say that at this point based on what we have seen we are not considering that a significant headwind that we are considering for 2023 and would view it as something that we can manage through.I mean based on whatâ€™s come out so far and then thatâ€™s what it would suggest. And we will have to see where the final rates come in.Yes. And the one thing I would add to Bruceâ€™s comment is today the model is deployed in markets that are heavy risk-based primary care. So we are moving into markets where thatâ€™s not the same dynamic. And so we are really interested to see how these first implementations go and assuming those go well then I do think we would look to go ahead and accelerate some of the further expansion. But I want to make sure we fully assess sort of how the model works and anything that we need to learn in the environment recognizing itâ€™s a little bit different.Yes. Hi Gary. And so to your point there is a lot of noise just the last couple of years due to COVID and the impact to sort of claims submission timelines capitated provider surplus amounts in payments. And I know we have talked about that in the last number of quarters and the magnitude of the impact of those dynamics. And so thatâ€™s why we provided the reference to the pre-COVID levels which we think is a better benchmark to assess this itâ€™s hard to otherwise normalize for all of those considerations. And so as you said we are sitting three days above what our average ran pre-COVID which we view is the more relevant compare to and feel good about the level of reserves that we are sitting on as of the end of the quarter.Yes. So I would say in terms of whatâ€™s currently sitting in DCP to the degree some of our reserve estimates for the first quarter or prior year proved to be conservative as that would unwind then that would have been some of what is currently reflected in the reserve levels. And the way we thought about in our plan anyway we sort of layered in that conservatism ratably. And as we said in the earlier commentary we certainly did not see a net COVID headwind in the first quarter but we are being cautious about how we think about unit cost trend in particular.,0.002760682,0.003118157,0.000187946
118,118,CMG,Niccol:,"No it was normal John. It was more in kind of that mid-single-digit kind of range. I mean remember we took that big step up that 15% raise back in the second quarter. And so it's been more in the normal range but it's on top of the 15% we already took.No look I think there is a real opportunity frankly to make the restaurant be much more efficient. Obviously Chippy is our first attempt. And we've worked with a lot of our employees to identify what are the tasks that they would love to see us bring automation to or AI so that hopefully the role can become less complicated. And then I think there is just other places in the back of the restaurant where we have the ability to automate whether it's on the digital make-line or other tasks. I think there is just tremendous opportunity for us to become even more efficient where it results in a better employee experience and also a better customer experience. And that's really the lens we're using on this.Look I think the technology is very close in. The ability then to scale it and get it installed. That's what we have to learn. And we're getting ready to put Chippy into a restaurant and then we've got a lot of other initiatives in works at our Cultivate Center. So the technology is actually close in. The prototypes are close in. It's then putting it through the stage gate process and really understanding people's ability to scale up and then actually install assuming it performs the way we think it's going to perform.Yes. So it's twofold. It is having better deployment which obviously the labor scheduling tool will help us with that. It also better informs our forecasting as well versus moving from just looking back over the prior four weeks and trying to project up prior four weeks. It's now using real-time information to project what's going to happen in the coming week. So what we see is a better forecast which results in a better schedule. And then what it also helps us do is deploy correctly. And the reason why the deployment is important is we need people to be in their positions right. And the most â€“ probably most pressing spot is that expedited role which is really in between kind of the last phase of making your bowl of burrito and getting to cash. And if the team isn't deployed correctly but sometimes that's the spot that doesn't get the right support. And as a result it kind of slows the line down. But obviously it all has to work in concert right. You need to have people that have had a lot of reps. They need to be trained to be able to move people down the line and make the bowls and burritos correctly. But it's the combination of those two things having people in the right positions and arguably one of the most important positions is that expediter position the way you get there is to make sure you got a right forecast.No. The biggest thing I would tell you is the more we see people have mobility the more we see our lunch business come back. And the nice thing is we've seen these new occasions whether it's a dinner occasion or a group occasion remain pretty sticky in the business. So I think the thing that is playing out is what people that have had experience with us for new occasions love the culinary and they're using us for these other occasions. And our rewards program I think is doing a nice job of understanding those journeys and then building the right engagement going forward. So mobility is a key piece of the puzzle because you want people out and about and you want people go into their office or going to their activity. That's how you get that restaurant experience back.Yes. Look I think the one thing I want to emphasize on labor is what we've heard from people that are with our company. So they've been with us five six seven years what they get excited about is all the growth because they can go from being an apprentice to a general manager to a field leader to a team director regional vice president. And it's a reality because we're building 200 300 restaurants a year. They know they have to be developing themselves and others so that they can step into the next opportunity. That's where they get the greatest change in both I would say professional satisfaction as well as the wages that come with it. We do know we've got a very competitive starting wage but what people get really excited about is where that starting wage can take them. And our company can take them really far and also really quick. So it's great that we have all the other benefits that I think separate us and continue to be consistent with our purpose of cultivating a better world. But when I've had the opportunity to get out in the field and talk to people what they're really excited about is the fact that they're a part of a company that's committed to its purpose and committed to growth. And that growth is both for them as an individual as well as those that work around them. And that's what we're going to keep investing in. So we haven't seen a whole lot of pressure on the starting wage where we are putting a lot of pressure is on making sure that we're developing our people so they're ready for the growth.Yes sorry delivery mix is like low 20s 20% 21%.No no. Go ahead.You know gosh I really hope we don't have to take more pricing but I'm going to kind of give you the same answer I've been giving you for the last call it 12 months which is if it moves and we can't find efficiencies to offset it the good news is we've got the pricing power to make a move. I really don't want to be ahead of it. So I think a great example is probably what you just saw over this last quarter. Look inflation continued to move in a big way. We saw it wasn't going away so we had to take the pricing action that we did. And hopefully that won't continue to be the case. But if it has to be the case we have I think the organization the people and the pricing power to do it but it really is the last thing I'd like to do.Yes sure. So obviously that's looking back at 2021. And yes look there were a lot of ups and downs with Omicron. There were a lot of ups and downs with wages. And obviously that was a tough time to be running restaurants. There was a lot of situations where you were understaffed. And then it was very hard to get people to sign up to work. And the good news is we've made tremendous progress. Obviously we've increased our starting wage. I think we've done a much better job of explaining the growth path at our company. And then illustrating that growth path by having 90% of our promotions come from internal promotion â€“ internal employees. So that's why when you fast forward to 2022 we're in just such a better place with stability definitely at the manager level. And then I think that will follow into the crew. So what the challenges were in 2022. I think we get them. And we're leaning into our purpose values and growth platforms to keep people excited about being at Chipotle.Yes. Look I mean what we're committed to is developing our people and growing people that want to be at Chipotle. And the best thing we can do is make sure that they're trained so that they're successful in their job and then that we give them a culture and a leader that develops them so they realize they have the growth opportunities at Chipotle. And that's why â€“ look I can't remember who asked the question but it's kind of â€“ hopefully you're not surprised by my answer when you asked like well what's next after Chippy. Well the answer is we talk to our employees to find out what would be the tasks that would make sense for us to automate in the restaurant to make the employee experience better because we know if the employee experience improves we'll have better retention and also we'll have better execution than for our customers. And so we really spend a lot of time communicating and taking action on how we can improve the employee experience. And then we spend the time developing our people. And you mentioned we just had this all manager conference right. I mean it was electric man. It was so great to have all our leaders in one place understanding the future of Chipotle and how they play such a critical role. And we had the opportunity to have everybody in the room stand up that's been promoted over the last four years and you know what almost every person in the room was standing up. I don't think there are many places where that happens so we have to continue to stay committed to our purpose our culture and the development of our people. So that when you end up at all manager conferences and you got just about everybody in the room standing up because they've been promoted or they've developed others that have gotten promoted so that's what we're focused on. That's our proposition. That's who we are. If you want to be a part of that we're going to be building lots of restaurants that present an opportunity for you to be a part of it.Yes sure. So I'll just close this real quick. Thanks for taking the time. Thanks for the questions obviously very proud of our results in the quarter. Very proud of the work that's been done today. I think the one thing that's worth reminding people there's a few things that haven't changed right. We have a great brand we've got a great culture. We've got a unique purpose around cultivating a better world. And we've got tremendous growth in front of us both within the existing restaurant between the combination of our in-restaurant opportunity and our digital business as well as adding additional restaurants across the country. And one thing that I'm confident about is our culture. Our people will capture the upside for this business and continue to drive growth going forward. So thank you for taking the time. And I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care.""",0.003096068,0.003516316,0.000277287
119,119,MCK,Thank,you for the questions. Maybe I'll start I mea if you wind the clock back to almost a decade ago when we expanded into Europe. I think there were multiple elements for the company to strategically go to Europe one of them; one of many was the opportunity to make sure we stayed leading in our generics procurement capabilities and scale. I think over the last years we continue to invest in that capability. We have a very successful partnership in ClarusONE and we're very confident that we have not just the scale but also the procurement expertise. And then we have a very contemporary generic procurement operation that will continue to be a leading generic operation after the divestiture of the European assets that we've discussed. So we're quite confident in our -- the productivity and the yield results we see from ClarusONE and we believe that will continue to be the case into the future.you and let me add my congratulations as well. Brian and Brett I just want understand biosimilars. So you talk just now about operating profit how much of an impact are biosimilars having and then as we think about the comments Brian that you made both around oncology and bio services how do we think about that going forward especially on the oncology side. What types of investments are you making how important are biosimilars as these programs are going to make acquisitions? How do we think about that?you for the question Lisa. I'll maybe start with biosimilars and then round into the oncology question. I mean biosimilars we think we are very well positioned given our strength in the specialty business and including the oncology elements of that. It's still from our perspective is fairly early days there's just under a dozen in the marketplace today we think the pipeline does look good and that given the assets we have in oncology and biopharma and our footprint in the specialty space we will benefit from that and we have seen a growing impact of biosimilars over the last several quarters. As it relates to oncology we use the word ecosystem. And that's really just to try to introduce this notion that there are many assets that McKesson has that relate to our oncology businesses whether it's just distribution specialty distribution GPOs health economics outcome research the latest addition to that portfolio of assets is the data and insights business that we call Ontada. And when we think of the oncology ecosystem we think of these as all kind of self reinforcing and adding momentum to each other. We add providers that add scale to GPO that adds more customers and data to Ontada as Ontada matures as partnerships expand and we get more insights we funnel that back a to provider which makes us a more attractive solution provider to them. So that's really how we're thinking about it. It's each into themselves is a good business we think but together we think there's real differentiation and strength.you. The International DNA dynamics are interesting. Thank you for that detail. Maybe a two parter Britt. One is when we think about the remaining European business can you provide us some sense of scale? I think the last time we got a salacious number without Canada was around $230 million about profit. And then on the DNA could the same circumstances exist for the remaining EU business? Should you get to a sale?you Ricky. I think there's lots of interest in data and insights and understanding patient and provider behavior as relates to these oncolytics. Our primary focus in Ontada is really to leverage the data and the working relationships and the scale of our physician relationships to generate insights that help the development the discovery and ultimately the launch and adoption of oncology products. And likewise to take the early lessons we get in the research and the development and launch planning around these products to ensure that providers are most able to react adopt and get great patient outcomes from that. So we see it as a very virtuous cycle really anchored in provider and in the biopharma companies. But there may be several other interested parties in the data insights that we can generate. And that's something that certainly consider as the business matures.you for your question. I'll give you one example in a medical business as an example. What we saw in the June quarter was that primary care patient visits improved from the fourth quarter back to about 95% in pre COVID level. So continuing to see the improvement but not back at pre COVID level. So when we speak about utilization we are seeing pre COVID levels for oncology and for specialty. We're not seeing that quite yet for primary care patient visits as an example continuing to improve on the trajectory that we laid out in our earnings call that we had expected. But that's one example for our business that is perhaps a little bit different.,0.329569558,0.982679367,0.461818445
120,120,FCX,Adkerson:,"Emily those really aren't driving factors on our investment decisions. The resources that we have are just economically not that sensitive to even these kind of price increases. So we -- our timing issue on the brownfield development projects is one related to engineering and permitting and community relations and things like that. These are things that affect supply development across the industry and it's a double-edged sword of copper. It's a major factor of why copper prices are so strong. So we'll factor in the higher prices but when we undertake a project the investment decision is not going to be driven by those factors but by others. For example in Chile we're awaiting making investment decision on El Abra which is a great project but there's a lot of uncertainties about the government policy towards mining in Chile. And so that's what we're monitoring before we make -- proceed with an investment decision there.And on position how well positioned Freeport is to take advantage of that -- those advancements. We're the largest leaching operation in the world. Morenci is the largest single mine from leaching and it's been part of our company's experience for decades. So we're really excited about it.Well thanks Emily and I'll let Kathleen follow up. But we do have a special situation with our large workforce in Peru where under government laws and regulations there is a mandated profit-sharing plan. And so as profits goes up their workers automatically benefit in higher wages as part of that process. But Kathleen why don't you follow up generally on labor cost elsewhere?That's really not a significant factor. I mean there may be a short-term contract that gets renegotiated. But costs -- the cost you see are essentially the current costs that we're experiencing now.And while there's uncertainties my expectation is we're facing kind of the height of dislocations from global supply chains to other factors. COVID shutdown in China and situation in Ukraine so my personal expectation is rather than seeing costs going up in the future we'll see them come down. But time will tell.We can.And Alex that's 1 thing I've been trying to get across to policymakers and others who follow our industry just about how long term the copper business is. I participated in Cambridge Energies the CERAWeek down in Houston with oil and gas companies and everybody was asking the oil and gas companies about the time for response to production and they were talking about it the executives with the energy companies were saying """"Well it's a long-term business. It takes months to respond."""" And I said """"Well copper takes years to respond."""" And so that's why I pointed out at Grasberg and there was a lot of pressure on us to -- for periods of time to delay development of the Grasberg underground as we were talking with the Government of Indonesia about our contract rights. But had we done that we wouldn't have had this production available to us. And so what we're looking at when we talk about growth is growth from a very long-term basis. And it's one of the reasons why we have a favorable copper price and why I believe copper prices are going to go higher. I mean we're seeing companies across our energy industry today being challenged with meeting their production targets. We've done that. But it's going -- all of that's going to be supportive of prices. And as I said I'm really struck by having today's copper price in the kind of global market with headwinds that would normally lead to lower prices.Yes. We would. It's just such a great asset. Funny historical story before the Phelps Dodge deal. I called the Phelps Dodge CEO when he sold down originally interest in Cerro Verde. At a time when they needed production and I said """"What are you doing?"""" I wish they had kept greater production. We got great partners. But yes it's such a great long-term asset and those kinds of quality of assets are really really scarce in our business. And while that's a project that we can enhance growth at the margin it's not a project where there's going to be a step-change change in volumes in the future. We've got some leaching opportunities there. We can be more efficient. We can overcome some of the issues that COVID has caused us but it's just a great long-term asset with our positive view of the copper markets. We're glad we have it and we wish we own more.Yes. And the facts are because of these time challenges in pursuing investments with strong copper prices cash is going to come in faster than it's going to go out. So that's something our Board is going to have -- will be considering going forward. And the 50% was a guidance for investors to understand what our thinking is but it's not any sort of fixed in stone situation.No not really. We've worked really hard with the local community in Arequipa and have established a positive relationship. We did some really important things in terms of community investment over the years. We built a freshwater system for the city and second largest city in Peru. And then we developed a -- for a city that didn't have -- that was just dumping its wastewater into the River Chile we developed a wastewater collection and processing facility. And so the ecology of the river has really improved which has been very positive in many levels with agriculture interest and so forth. So we've done a lot. We pay people well. We managed through COVID effectively and it was challenging. But fortunately we have a really positive relationship with the local community and we work hard to preserve that.Well we're advancing. It's still early days. We're working with a group of different technologies. Some of it's proprietary some of it's with outside contractors and some is in joint ventures with other companies in Latin America. So we're excited about it. But we haven't yet been able to forecast of what we believe will ultimately be a significant incremental production. Kathleen mentioned 200 million pounds a year is a target we're currently working for that's focused on our existing active leach stacks. But there's other opportunities if this works as we anticipate it would with some old historical inactive leach stacks and potentially be an alternative to investments in concentrators to process sulfide ores. So it's -- I get pumped up when I talk with our technical team about it and they brief me on what's going on because of the excitement they're expressing. But we'll keep you informed keep the market informed as we're able to get more visibility about incremental production.No these are just normal mine plan adjustments that come up as conditions change. When you look at the numbers from Grasberg it looks like it's almost like an assembly line process but we're constantly dealing with changes in geology and other conditions. But there's nothing unusual there and it's certainly nothing that has a fundamental change in the low-cost operations there. Mark Johnson is on the line and he's our longtime head of operations there at Grasberg. And Mark why don't you make a comment in response to this question.Well I mean there's just -- things are just piling up that's adding to the supply constraints. I mean that's a story 20 years ago when China emerged there was a general expectation that there would be a major supply response as there always had been in copper before that. But then people started looking hard and it's been going on for 20 years now. Copper has been at the top of the strategic objectives of the major mining companies ever since then. And it's a combination of geology the quality of deposits are much much lower than they were before. They're in much more challenging jurisdictions. Often their grades are lower many are underground and so that's been a factor that's overriding everything. And now with 40% of the copper coming from Chile and Peru and those companies -- countries going through political discussions about the direction of how they're going to be treating the industry that's clearly a factor that's out there. And as things get delayed because of the amount of time that requires to develop even a straightforward project like this mill project we have at Bagdad that is about as simple project as you could have but it's taken several years to get engineering and permit. It's just a question of building a new mill building some tailings facilities. I mean there's nothing really that complicated. But when you start looking at projects that are really complicated that are really in challenging jurisdictions you can see around the world communities opposing new developments while we benefit in the U.S. because ours are brownfield and we have good relationships with communities that we worked hard to keep people who are trying to build new mines in the U.S. are running into really serious delays and sometimes brick walls about not being able to go forward. So these things are just pyramiding and absent some really significant global economic event I'm just hard-pressed to see where we're not heading for an environment of where copper prices are going to be very high. And there's going to be real challenges as people try to substitute get more scrap develop new projects. All of those things have barriers. So as I said at the start I'm really confident about our strategy of being a copper company. And I think we're really well suited to benefit for our stakeholders by being good at execution as we've shown; by being focused; by doing things the right way; by building relationships. We mentioned Peru same way in the U.S. same way in Indonesia. We learned long ago and our experience in coming up and developing the Grasberg in Indonesia was you cannot turn a blind eye to the local people. You have to give them jobs opportunities benefits and so we've learned those lessons and it's paying off for us. And I think it will continue to pay off for us.Yes. Well El Abra and Lone Star are different. And when we acquired Phelps Dodge 15 years ago El Abra was viewed as a declining short-term asset. And it was through our explore to our drilling that we discovered there is large sulfide deposit and it's very large but it's at altitude it requires desalinization energy and so forth. So it would be an expensive project but certainly one that would be economic with today's and current process. And so it's just a question of seeing what Chile does and then doing all the work we have to do to get ready for it. The stripping side of things and I'll let Josh say a couple of comments about it is really what's happening at Lone Star which is adjacent to our historical Safford mine just across the mountain ridge from Morenci. And again a place where we have great community support to do what we're doing. But there we are expanding this oxide production and it's serving as a stripping towards a sulfide resource that we're continuing to evaluate and sort through how to development. The 10-year -- Josh why don't you make a couple of comments about it?All right. Well thanks everybody for your interest and I'll just close and say I hope to see both Lone Star and El Abra's projects get kicked off. So that will give you some time frame on it. And we are really proud of our team and really feel good about where we are and where we're going. So thank you for your interest and we look forward to reporting our progress in the future.",0.002849865,0.003292441,0.00024044
121,121,EW,Mussallem:,Yes. So we're in the process of building that U.S field team. And we're building with the idea that we really want to ensure that we do a great job of training our own team and trainings of physicians and really doing this in a very deliberate fashion. So it's going to be a pretty gradual and deliberate build out for us. And we're going to focus on having excellent procedural success and clinical outcomes. And so we're taking a pretty thoughtful approach to this rather than broad base. We're going to try and stay in accounts that already do quite a bit of a transcatheter and have real experience in doing it and are likely to be able to attain a high level of competency and maintain that. So hopefully that gives you some sense of how we're thinking about it.Sure.Sure. Well we have -- we certainly have design intent and SAPIEN X4. We believe that it's going to have improved paravalvular leak performance. We also think that it's going to have RESILIA tissue on it which we think is a big plus and add durability. And it also just has a chance to address some of the variability that's in patients. And so we think it has a number of advantages and we look forward to trying that out. In terms of the pulmonic opportunity I really haven't gotten into the news today that's happened on that. We're just now rolling out the Alterra product. We've been pleased with that. This isn't a really large group. I think compared to the overall TAVR market it probably gets lost in the numbers. It's not really that big of an opportunity but boy these are patients that really really need the help and so we feel a real obligation to be able to help them through a tough time.Yes.Yes. Thanks Rick. Well maybe it's something that just a clarifying point is remember we're just selling in Europe at this point.And so when you talk about this transcatheter edge-to-edge therapy the supporting evidence in Europe hasn't been overwhelmingly positive it's been somewhat mixed. And so that's led to a growth rate in Europe that's been probably less than what it should be. And we think there's going to be a real contribution when the family of class trials become apparent we think has a chance to really lift market adoption. And that's going to be one of the pluses. And then as I said earlier adding new sites is going to be a positive us growing the team is going to be positive and all those are going to be additional add ons.Okay. Thanks so much for your continued interest in Edwards. Scott and Mark and I are going to welcome any additional questions by telephone later on.,0.003686905,0.004903257,0.001216352
122,122,MMM,Roman:,Good morning Steve.Yes. Thanks Steve.Good morning.Yes Julian. So as we've talked in the past we've had some certain operations shut down at that plant and we continue to work on -- with local authorities on the updated permits that we have there and continue to work to resolve that. We're a leading provider out of that plant for specialty fluids including heat transfer fluids that are used in semiconductor and we're working to address the operational disruptions we have. Zwijndrecht is an important source of supply for those materials to our customers. And so we're working to resolve it there so we can continue to supply from there. We're also looking to supply from capacity that we have at alternative sites where possible. So it's it was an impact that we saw in Q1. It's something that's built into our outlook. It is something we're working with customers on to address any ongoing disruption for them. So it's something we'll keep updating you on as we mitigate the impacts and we can update you as appropriate going forward.Yeah. There is a process we're working through. And so there's some uncertainty there. We've got to resolve the permit issues there. We've got a permit renewal as we go through the year. So this is all something that we're working on. We've been careful to say that we have certain operations that have been interrupted at this time. There's a potential for operations to resume. There's a potential for operation â€“ additional operations to shut down. So we've been careful to lay out the possibilities. What we saw in â€“ in Q1 was part of our results and is an interruption that we're working on with customers.Yeah. And Julian as you recall we realigned around our businesses back in March of 2019. So we really are managing each of our four go-to-market models globally and executing in the areas. We update you on just how we're performing overall in the areas of the world. And so EMEA down 2% in Q1 really was led by declines in our Consumer and Safety and Industrial businesses. Transportation and Electronics was down slightly. Health care was up actually low single digits in the quarter. So we saw some impact from both I would say COVID as well as the supply chain disruptions and the â€“ I would say the challenges in Ukraine. So it's a â€“ it is an ongoing dynamic that we're watching closely. We saw strong growth in a number of our businesses as we came through the quarter and Monish walked through the outlook on the macro. So certainly that will have an impact on EMEA. But I would say we're watching it closely as we look at the rest of the year.Hi Jeff.Yes. So Jeff we still have two combat arms bellwether cases to go here in May. So those are the next the next two trials on the docket. Beyond that it's a little less clear what the next cases will be. If you look at PFAS the other one trial schedules I would say have been moving frequently. We we're currently scheduled for two trials this year. We have a June trial in Michigan and then we have an October trial in Alabama. The Aqueous Film Forming Foam multi-district litigation the first trial there is not expected until 2023. So that gives you kind of an update.Yes.Hi Andy.Hi Joe.Yeah. Sure Joe. I'll start with what you said it were down low-single digits in the first quarter that was reminder a top of 30% or more than 30% growth in Q1 of last year. Weâ€™ve been impacted in Q1 by the COVID lockdowns. It's impacting manufacturing and distribution. And we saw that as we finished the quarter â€“ it's also contributing to I would say a soft start to April as well. And it's really driving increasing backlog factory shutdowns for us also complying with government safety mandates you're seeing increased port congestion reduced air cargo capacity. So a number of things impacting that softer start. I would say it's â€“ the outlook remains uncertain. It's difficult to predict. We see maybe a one percentage point kind of headwind as we start Q2 but that can change as we go through the year. So it's â€“ it's important market we're seeing in Q1 we saw health care leading the way up mid-teens. We saw declines across consumer safety industrial and transportation and electronics all down mid-single digits. So that's what got you to the low single digits.Hi Andrew.Yeah Andrew I would say you highlighted a couple of those particular challenges. The supply chain more broadly is impacting all of our businesses. So we're seeing disruptions in raw materials logistics inflation all that's impacting broadly our portfolio. Consumer did have organic growth up 3% in Q1 on top of 9% last year. And it was across all divisions. It was led by consumer health and safety also our home care and our home improvement products continue to lead the way. So we're seeing growth. And stacked on top of last year's growth we're seeing good continued performance good performance. They're not seeing any specific or particular impact. And if you look across the portfolio aside from some of the disruptions from Zwijndrecht we're not seeing supply chain focused in one part of our portfolio and other. It is I would say more -- some of the impacts maybe from COVID having a geographic impact. Health care elective procedures still looking for there. And as Monish highlighted the outlook for the macro in certain end markets is softening. That's less about supply chain disruptions. Maybe automotive and electronics being impacted by semiconductor shortages but its really more end market slowdowns that are impacting our businesses where you see an impact on something like electronics or automotive.Yes Andrew our M&A strategy an important part of capital allocation. We see it as a place we can create value. And the way we create value there is as you're pointing at we look at prioritizing attractive markets higher growth markets that can leverage 3M capabilities our technology our manufacturing our global reach to customers. And so that really kind of steers us in our strategy for M&A. And when we can identify companies that we can integrate into 3M and really leverage those strengths of 3M that's -- and move into more attractive higher-growth market spaces that's what's going to drive us whether it's in opportunities around electronics or any one of our four businesses.Hey Brendan.Good morning Deane.Yeah. Nigel maybe I'll just try to kind of frame this up a little bit. So there are two parts to what we're managing in Zwijndrecht and I would say in our manufacturing sites around the world there's a historical impact of the PFAS chemistries PFOA-PFOS that we exited and announced the exit almost 20 years ago now and â€“ or exit almost 20 years ago. And then there's ongoing operations. And so we're working on both of those in Zwijndrecht as the charge that we announced in March was to resolve remediation related to that historical PFOA-PFOS manufacturing. And then we're working with the authorities and Flanders around an operating permit going forward. And that's something that we've been doing around the world at our five sites with regulatory authorities and continue to do that. It's â€“ PFAS continues to be a critical PFAS substances. There's more than 4 000 of them. We continue to have some PFAS in our products that is critical to customer needs in health care electronics automotive. And so the -- its something weâ€™re managing with those sites managing with those authorities and something we'll keep you updated on as appropriate as we go forward.To wrap up we had a good start to the year with solid growth sequential margin expansion and strong cash generation. We are positioned for a successful 2022 and we'll stay focused on taking care of our customers driving growth and improving our operational performance. Thank you for joining us.,0.00378646,0.00529933,0.000987426
123,123,F,Lawler:,And the other thing I would add is that the demand as Jim said earlier is very strong for our new products and that's encouraging for us. We just can't build enough of them and we see that demand continuing. Q - Dan Levy And the mix assumption within this?The mix assumption is that we'll revert back to a normal run rate mix that we would expect to see. We were disproportionately hit in the first quarter by a commodity module and Hau can talk more about that. He's better to talk about it than I â€“ than me than I can. And his â€“ the team has worked through that. So we believe we have that resolved. So we should see a more normal run rate of our mix as we move forward.Sure. On the redesign there's efficiencies that we're seeing as we work through the redesign across each of the markets that we've restructured. And so you're starting to see that show up. There's also some timing differences in there as well where the work we're doing is let's say taking a bit longer to get to a solution or a final position with some of the counterparties we're working with. And we also announced the fact that we will be selling our [indiscernible] facility to AutoZone and that's going to allow to bring cash into that restructuring that we have there as well for global redesign. So that's the short of it from that standpoint. The other point I think the question was around -- remind me what it was?Yes. Right. So the lower CapEx--Yes. So the lower CapEx that reflects no change in our intended investment in electrification or our fully networked architecture et cetera. It's just timing differences in this year relative to what we saw at the beginning of the year. So you can still expect us to continually invest. We have the capital to do that. The balance sheet's strong. So it doesn't reflect anything on where we see the business heading. It's just timing differences for the most part.Yes it's more of working capital. Yes. Absolutely.Yes. So I think what you see there is exactly that. There's no change to Ford Credit. We are seeing higher inflationary pressures. We are seeing higher top line pricing that's coming through but we're also working on cost offsets as well. So I think it largely remains what we had talked about last time. We're just seeing higher inflationary pressures and higher pricing flow through.No. I don't think that it's as high as $2.5 billion Emmanuel. It's -- there's growth in there but it's not as high as that. I think that when you look at the walk relative to what we had provided last time most of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing are being offset by a combination of additional cost reductions pricing and mix that's flowing through but it's not as large as that as what you had just indicated.And then on the dividends the dividends are a function of overall profits and balance sheet size and leverage. And in this case you heard the guidance on profits and into the balance sheet. We don't expect much growth this year just given where we are in the vehicle constraints. So the majority of profits â€“ we don't have a specific number.,0.002739638,0.002801776,6.21E-05
124,124,MCO,Fauber:,Andrew itâ€™s Rob. So to answer the first question yes and again in line with some of the earlier commentary we would expect most of that to be in the second quarter most of that kind of downward adjustment. Your question -- your second question was about RMS growth. And I guess I would say just at a high level we have expected RMS growth to accelerate through the balance of the year. And in fact sales are performing as or even slightly better than we have expected. So from our perspective RMS is performing kind of exactly as we have planned and I guess I would point out a couple of important things that are going on there. Obviously we have got the corporate integration but we have really been focused on aligning the sales teams. And I have mentioned in the past we have had some very good dialogue with some of our mutual customers about things that we can do together. So we are seeing a lot of excitement from our customers and we have started now on some of the joint product development. And one interesting example maybe to highlight is around commercial mortgage-backed securities. We have mapped every property thatâ€™s got an outstanding loan in a CMBS security with RMS data and that allows us to help our customers better understand the physical risk associated with their portfolios. And really we are now leveraging that in both our ratings and research in a way that I think is very differentiated. Thatâ€™s taking that RMS capability and then being able to bring that to both our issuers and our investor customers. So again we believe that we are on track. We are feeling good about it. The integration and product development and sales execution is going at pace.Yeah. Ashish so we frequently talk about on this call the impact of mix as it relates to issuance and this is one of those quarters where mix worked against us from a revenue growth standpoint. In this case our transaction revenues were a little bit lower or that the decline was a little higher than the decline in issuance activity obviously in turn our 20% down benefited from recurring revenue growth. But really what was going on here Ashish is the leveraged finance markets were pretty anemic in the first quarter and you heard me talk about the dearth of infrequent issuers. All of that stuff contributes then to an unfavorable mix for us in the first quarter.Yeah. Ashish itâ€™s -- Mark and I were having a conversation about this. And itâ€™s interesting if you step back and compare our revised 2022 guidance to the last pre-pandemic year of 2019. And I think we all understand that 2020 and 2021 were pretty unusual years. But if you compare our 2022 guidance to 2019 the issuance will be up double digits and MIS revenues will be up in the high-teens percent range over 2019. Now if you annualize that so I turn that into a CAGR thatâ€™s something like low and thatâ€™s remarkably similar to both the periods [Technical Difficulty] pandemic. I look back at kind of 2000 [Technical Difficulty] revenue CAGR in the mid single-digit range but itâ€™s also very similar to our medium-term guidance. I talked about the things that we believe are still intact that support the medium-term guidance and on the last call we talked about hey look in the first year or two of this medium-term horizon we expected the growth to be more muted and in fact I think we are certainly seeing that. But for the reasons I described we still feel good about the medium-term growth outlook for MIS.Yeah. Great question and the answer is yeah absolutely. When you think about it from our customerâ€™s perspective we have talked about this. They are just dealing with a wider range of more interconnected risks and having to figure out how to deal with all that and so increasingly our customers are wanting to be able to kind of connect the dots. And so I think that the expansion of our capabilities and thinking about it from this concept of providing integrated perspectives on risk is adding -- is allowing us to do new logos so new customer segments customer types as well as deepen our relationships with existing customers. So I will give you an example. We have been expanding into now serving social media companies that have e-commerce platforms who want to better understand whoâ€™s transacting on the platform. We have been now extending into serving new crypto and digital asset companies same thing. We -- so thereâ€™s a great example of new customer segments that we are able to serve. But also you take our [Technical Difficulty]. I am thinking of -- we had an Asian bank that we serve and we helped them around stress testing and they came to us and said hey can you help us measure and manage ESG and climate risk because we are going to have to comply with regulatory stress tests that incorporate these factors? And the answer is absolutely we can help you with that. And so thatâ€™s a great example of them being able to broaden and deepen the relationship with that customer. So like I said I think you are going to see it two ways new customer segments and expanding the relationship with existing customers.Yeah. I guess I would say kind of our M&A program is not really kind of dictated by whatâ€™s going on in the issuance markets. We are very much focused on the product road maps that we have got in terms of what our customers want and need. In fact you have actually seen us make an investment in the MIS business in the first quarter with our acquisition of GCR in Africa and that is a very long-term play for us. So we are going to keep investing in that franchise. Itâ€™s a great business. And on the MA side we will be guided by customer needs and product road maps.Yeah. Iâ€™d say just at a very high level. I mean itâ€™s still a competitive job market. So yes thereâ€™s been a some form of kind of correction in the equity markets. But we are very focused on Iâ€™d say kind of broadly our employee value proposition. And compensation is a very important part of that and Mark talked about the investments that we are making to make sure we have competitive compensation in the market. But there are a number of other things that that go into it as well and we are finding workplace flexibility is really important. And we have leaned into flexibility we have done a great job over the last two years and so we are going to continue to do that. We think that thatâ€™s going to be a competitive advantage for us in terms of attracting talent.Yeah. Owen good to hear from you. So we had very strong performance in MA really across the Board. And maybe I would highlight just a few things and this hopefully will give you a sense for the momentum that we have in the business. But the growth in Decision Solutions there we had 20% organic constant dollar recurring revenue growth. So thatâ€™s when you think about organic recurring revenue growth ex the impact of FX and we are just seeing very strong demand for KYC and compliance solutions ongoing. And there if you think about whatâ€™s happening with our customers thereâ€™s an intense demand right now for tools that help with not only sanctions compliance but just better understanding the risk of who you are connecting to who you are doing business with. So customers of course but also thinking about supply chain. And so we are really leaning into that. You heard that the usage stats are up significantly. Thatâ€™s a very good kind of leading indicator. Owen of when you see heavy usage you can expect that you are deepening the value props your customers are realizing the value proposition of your solutions that ultimately can lead into supporting pricing. It can support cross-sell and upsell at customers. Our sales activity is picking up. We had a need program where we were doing actually screening our customersâ€™ portfolios for them. So that they can get a sense of what they might be missing in their own screening processes. So and on top of that we made several investments last year. As you know we made several acquisitions but also we have been investing heavily in internal product development. And so with the PassFort workflow platform that we acquired we have now been really working on integrating our content sets into that working on rolling out some new products where our customerâ€™s continue to need help in terms of efficiency and effectiveness and not only around KYC but also around suppliers. So I could probably go on across the portfolio but it gives you a sense Owen of very good performance in the quarter but very good momentum as well.Hey. Owen just one thing. I ran the M&A department for a bunch of years here and you are right the value of public assets has come down. But I will say that a lot of assets in our space if you have got companies that donâ€™t have leverage capital structures they are in no hurry to sell right? So it doesnâ€™t always mean that itâ€™s a more conducive M&A market when you see kind of a downturn in public market valuations.Hey. Simon itâ€™s Rob. So maybe just to give you a sense of some of the data points and color that goes into how we thought about the outlook. Maybe that will be helpful for you and I could also maybe even touch on a little bit just kind of kind of current market conditions. Obviously we donâ€™t have great visibility into the full year but we do have some visibility into the current market. But first of all just from investment grade obviously we have got that down for the year. We have got it down 10% for the year versus down mid-20%s for Q1. But there we think we will see some increased issuance to support opportunistic refi and M&A. So you had -- some of those issuers were just sitting on the sidelines. When you think about high yield and leveraged loans there the decreases that we are seeing for the year are substantially greater. And even though we think there will be a little bit of improvement through the balance of the year the broader market conditions including the equity market volatility wider spreads continued uncertainty around resolution of Russia and Ukraine all that impacts the leverage finance markets more than investment grade. When you see a lot of equity market volatility thatâ€™s typically very challenging for leveraged finance markets. When we look at the kind of public and infrastructure area where we expect that to be down something like mid-single digits but year-to-go roughly flat so some modest improvement baked in there again I think kind of like what we expect with the investment grade issuers. We expect that those infrastructure issuers are going to return from sitting on the sidelines in the first quarter. I think we will see lower supply from sovereigns who have done a lot of kind of prefunding over the last couple of years combined with some rising funding costs. Let me just touch on structured for a second too because there we had a very strong first quarter obviously. Our revenues were up 24% in structured finance. But you heard that we are actually looking for issuance to be down for the year. So whatâ€™s going on there? Well one you had some spread widening in some of these asset classes and concerns about rate increases. So there we did -- we do think we saw some pull-forward of issuance that supported that really strong first quarter. CMBS very strong and we expect that to continue for the year. But CLOs you think about whatâ€™s going on CLOs frequently tied to whatâ€™s going on in the leveraged loan market. So with leverage loans down meaningfully thereâ€™s less not only less leverage loan creation for new CLO formation but with spreads widening that will put a little bit of damper on refinancing activity. So thatâ€™s generally how we are thinking about the outlook. And then in terms of just the best visibility we have got is just kind of what the current market looks like. And I would say that the markets are open for business. We would expect in investment grade I would expect May to pick up off of April. April was a real mixed bag. There was more financial issuance than there was corporate. We had some blackouts and some of the corporates continued to sit out the volatility. Thereâ€™s a lot of dry powder for M&A but again volatility will dictate how much of that comes to the market. High yield is pretty sluggish. As I mentioned earlier the European high yield market has finally reopened after 11 weeks of no issuance. So we may see some M&A backlog there come to market. Leveraged loans are certainly stronger than high yield but off of a torrid pace. I mentioned we have got a good FTM backlog first time mandate backlog. So hopefully some of that will come to market. And the last thing I would say Simon is just looking at funds flows we have seen five consecutive weeks of fund inflows in leveraged loans while we have seen fund outflows for high yield almost through the balance of the year. So hopefully that gives you a sense of the data points that we are looking at in kind of building to our forecast.Yeah. Simon itâ€™s interesting. If you look all the way back to the global financial crisis MAâ€™s revenues proved to be pretty durable and resilient and I think that would be the case here if we have an economic downturn. When we talk about this stuff about itâ€™s in times of uncertainty when customers need us most that really is -- thatâ€™s true. You see that with MA and you are not going to see banks turning off their KYC vendors in running risk of regulatory noncompliance because they are trying to cut costs. So I donâ€™t want to be glib about it. But I would just say that the fundamental value proposition will remain intact during times of stress and uncertainty. I do believe that will be true.Yeah. Shlomo hi. Itâ€™s Rob. So the first quarter GDP print was a quarter-over-quarter trend. So that was growth relative to the first -- to the fourth quarter of 2021. And obviously in the fourth quarter of 2021 you had very strong GDP growth. It was almost about 7% and so I think we had expected some pullback in the first quarter which happened. If you look at it on a year-over-year basis for the quarter you actually had positive GDP growth I think in the kind of the 3.5 percentage range which is kind of still within the range that we are looking at for the balance of the year. There were some technical factors to that. But in general I would say that the key variable for us in terms of GDP growth is thinking about the geopolitical dynamics policy response to it and thereâ€™s still a lot of uncertainty around it. But in general we think our forecasts are in line with a number of other prognosticators.Yeah. So in a rising rate environment like we have got here we would expect to see CFOs and treasurers start to look at pulling forward issuance to get ahead of those rate increases. I mentioned earlier that we really didnâ€™t see much of that in the first quarter and thatâ€™s because I think the market volatility kind of overwhelmed the desire to kind of pull-forward and be opportunistic in the market. It was just a very difficult market to access if you didnâ€™t need to. So we have not built in substantial pull-forward into our forecast which is why I mentioned it earlier itâ€™s a possible upside. You could imagine to market volatility comes down a bit. We could see some of this pull-forward activity.Thanks Faiza. Itâ€™s Rob. Welcome to the call. Itâ€™s great to have you on and I am going to let Mark take this one.Well I just want to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you very much.,0.004536109,0.01376164,0.00377994
125,125,SNOW,Scarpelli:,Well what I will say is it does improve margins. And the way it improves margin is because storage becomes more efficient. Storage is a smaller component of the overall mix of the revenue and compute is the real value of our software that drives more margin. And I will say we did roll this out in April and you do see some of that coming into an impact on last quarter. But we did say at our IPO if you remember we thought we could get to the mid-70s. That might feel very good that we'll get to the mid-70s. It's going to take some time. And stay tuned for our Investor Day and we'll talk more about that later. I would say the biggest improvement we've seen to date in the gross margin has really been the renegotiation of our contracts with our cloud vendors and the discipline in our sales organization around discounting and coupled with the fact that as we move into larger enterprises we're selling more business-critical enterprise which attract a higher contribution margin.Well we don't disclose quota-carrying reps. And what I will say is we're going to add about 1 200 net employees for the full year and we do expect that we'll add about the same level into our sales organization this year as we did last year.Correct.I don't see a dip happening in our product gross margins at all but there is a limit to where you can get to. And when we're going through our IPO people were asking questions. I did say I don't see us getting into the 80s. I can see a path to the mid-70s. We may one day be able to get into the high 70s. But given the storage component and the costs associated with the public clouds are in there it's pretty hard to get beyond this.So there's FedRAMP high we're working on. ITAR is going to be out mid this year FedRAMP high end of the year. And obviously if we didn't see a big opportunity because there is a big cost associated with doing that we wouldn't be doing it. And we have a very good pipeline within the public sector. And we're very focused on it. As of today it's not a big driver of revenue. So there's a lot of upside there.Well it was a strong Q1 and bookings performance. And we estimate that 54% of that RPO will roll off into revenue over the next 12 months and it was 54% -- 55% last quarter. And I don't know what else there is to say about that but that's how we see it rolling off to revenue.Well as I said in the remarks we onboarded 436 net employees in the first half of the year. And so 1 200 is definitely front-end loaded. We always try to add a lot of people into our sales and marketing organization in the first month of the year to get the benefit of our sales kickoff. But definitely we're going to continue to add in the first half and it's going to be more skewed to that.Well last year was the first year we really incentivized our sales force to sell multiyear contracts. And what I would say is now it's getting more into the normal sales motion of our salespeople. It's more natural for them to be going in and asking customers to sign a 3-year contract. Historically we used to sell 1-year contracts only. And so we still do have renewals. There are still some customers on renewals that only want to do a 1-year renewal because that's what they've always done. And there are some customers especially ones where they're new customers they want to do a 1-year contract because they want to get to know us more. Generally those newer customers we're finding on renewals are doing the multiyear renewals with us as they're seeing everything they can do on Snowflake. But that's fully reflected in our RPO.,0.49566853,0.987745583,0.492077053
126,126,FDX,Lenz:,37:25 Ravi you broke up some there but I there was a reference to some of these items being non-operational in the second half I guess maybe I'd turn it around the other way and say if we were fullyâ€¦Well we're not sitting on our hands amidst the circumstances we're taking actions to mitigate it. So I wouldn't characterize it as just singularly looking at Q1 and changing as a result of the outcome of that. So we're aggressively managing every aspect there. 38:47 I guess I might turn it around the other way and say if you looked at our results in Q1 absent the labor availability challenges it would be extraordinary and thus we realize the absolute number matters and so we're taking actions on a number of fronts that will make the second half exactly as we outlined. I'll let Brie address your volume question for later as we go through the year.44:51 No just to reiterate I broke the labor impact into two pieces. The part that we're assuming that does mitigate as Raj outlined is the impact from the availability. Again the market wage rate is what it is and we can assume nothing different than that and that is what is baked in to the outlook.51:35 Sure Todd. Yes that's a fair characterization when I said the headwinds would be similar to the eight hundred million look the pandemic and many other factors impacting our market including the supply chain disruptions I think you have to kind of take pause in terms of assuming typical seasonality across the board. Yes there is a degree of that that you will see but I would say we can't just rely upon that because the dynamics are much more fluid than they were and thatâ€™s why we're trying to outline that as best we can but we're navigating those changes along the way but we're very confident what we shared with you.53:08 So Amit I'm just going to stick with it. We're not giving a margin forecast. What we outlined was that we expect operating profit to be up in all the transportation segments. So I'm not going to get into giving a specific margin forecast by quarter. And again the seasonality is we don't think it's value added to kind of get into trying to parse that at a level of precision given the dynamics of the market right now.54:27 Thank you Helane for that question. We actually have twelve thousand employees in China. As you know we have been in business in China since nineteen eighty four and we have been serving our customers there in this extremely important market. We value our business in China and we are committed to continuing to improve our value proposition there. Our growth in the market is very strong and our operations in our hub in Guangzhou is just going smoothly. We also just opened up new air operations from Beijing. So China remains a very important market for us and we are very committed to it.56:19 Right. Well Jack First let me just say you brought up about ROIC and I'll expand a little bit about on the remarks I made earlier there. We're obviously referencing to our WACC when we compare our ROIC which we put in the seven percent to nine percent range which I think is consistent with what we see in many of your analyses. But when it comes to the ROIC itself there are a number of different approaches and methods that practitioners use so this tends to be variability in the absolute as well as the comparative measurements but that said we're revisiting the various aspects of that so that we can maybe expand the context around our discussion of the topic but I will say regardless of how you calculate it our ROIC does remain above our WACC. 57:12 So since you asked about the LTI plan look I am not going to speak on behalf of the Board but I will give you some context around partly about what I mentioned two three months ago. So again we had record earnings in fiscal twenty one amidst the unprecedented global pandemic and delivering life-saving vaccines around the world. And weâ€™ve talked about the radical changes in supply chains customer expectations and all that so we did indeed accelerate purposefully some investment opportunities for capacity expansion and of course the replacement of the aircraft I mentioned before. So as I did specifically say on the June call the FY twenty two to twenty four LTI plan was eight percent to account for these opportunities and that target is below our historical capital intensity. Fiscal twenty one was seven percent but that was the lowest in ten years. So again there's absolutely a focus on returns and I think that we will continue to address your considerations there and I would also highlight because there was the question earlier about ground and investment there and we're making returns there. 58:41 And we talked a lot about how we're utilizing our assets differently more efficiently vesting in smaller units of capacity. We got the one single hub but thereâ€™s no other hubs on the drawing board if ground can generate a higher ROIC at different margin levels than it did probably eight nine years ago. So again that absolutely factors into how we look at these things.62:51 Bascome this Mike. So I'll let Raj address more broadly but just to clarify within that four fifty number of labor impact there is an impact there for freight in terms of the same considerations that we talked about there. So I don't want to have the takeaway or imply that the freight team isn't dealing with similar considerations there. 63:13 But I'll also highlight as I mentioned to Scott early on there that different networks and different transportation businesses can have different characteristics in that. So Raj do you want talk about the great things at freight?So I think if I understand the question it is a staffing availability issue on the two fifty million piece of it. For the two hundred million it's the rate. So just to reiterate that and like I said we fully expect and are beginning to see some improvement in the availability but should not â€“ should plan to not proceed as we fully expect. And like I said earlier we would need to obviously reassess the pace of implementing the initiatives there but the opportunity remains nonetheless. We just need to be mindful of the overall environment.,0.002578199,0.002967596,0.000276041
127,127,GM,Barra:,Yes. Kyle Vogt is on the phone. So I think Kyle if you'd like to take that question?All right. Thanks Kyle.Yes. We definitely are seeing not only new customers to General Motors but we are seeing a focus from both the East and the West Coast where there already is a stronger demand. So what we predicted that we would see is because we tend to underperform from a -- what I call our fair share perspective on the coast we are seeing exactly what we said that that was an opportunity for us to seize. We're seeing that in the reservations and also bringing new people to the company.So appreciate the question. And first of all we do believe over the long term people will see that our dealer network is a competitive advantage. They're highly experienced. We have not only the ability to meet the customer where they want whether they want to do something completely online or actually go to the store which cuts a lot of the customers. As we look at them they still want to go in and literally kick the tires. But what we have been doing is working together to unlock efficiencies to find a better way to serve the customers and to leverage those efficiencies. So we both reduce the overall cost of sale as opposed to looking at how the pie is divided. And we've been very successful at doing that as we roll out the new digital retail platform that we showed at Investor Day I think that is going to be that is going to be a huge enabler to reduce the cost of the sale. And again we will share in a piece of that. We're confident in our plans and we have the support of our network. We have over 95% of our Chevrolet EV dealers signing up to the platform and preparing for a phased rollout yet this year. And that's going to give customers the opportunity. They can expect to have accurate transparent pricing and they also will be able to compare across dealers. So we think that the work that we're doing with our dealers because we see them as a partner and making sure the customer has an overall exceptional customer ownership experience is going to be a distinguisher.Well as we look at MSRPs if we see -- there's a small handful of dealers that are not behaving consistent with the agreement we have with them. And we deal with them and they lose allocation. For the most part our dealers are respecting the MSRP. I have actually had dealers send me letters committing to me that they're doing that. So we address those handful of exceptions but for the most part I think that's what customers will see.Has not changed yes.Hey. And before we go to the next question let me -- I think in answer to Itay's question I found the information. For example on the Silverado EV 60% of the reservations are new to GM 70% of the reservations are from East and West Coast. So I was -- I didn't want to quote the numbers without confirming them. But Itay that's the numbers behind my answer to your question. Operator we can move on.Hi Adam.Adam it is small. And like I said we address it especially those that -- it's a high high number. So I don't have a percent off the top of my head. But again our dealers and we have done a lot of work with our dealers over the last couple of years especially as they sign into our agreements and make the investments necessary to sell EVs. So Iâ€™m very confident we have â€“ we'll continue to work with our dealers to serve the customer well and provide a great customer experience.Hey Adam you're fading out. I heard you say is there any part of your battery supply chain and then you faded out.For the numbers that we put out the 100 000 in 2022 and 2023 and the 1 million by 2025 barring something completely unforeseen I think that's where we are and we're working to find upside opportunity.And on the Cruise question it's just -- it's really too early in the first tender offer to start giving any of those numbers. So just it's too early to share anything there.So I think -- I appreciate that you recognize that we made the investments a handful of years ago that gives us the LTM platform where we really can do products like the Silverado EV that don't have any compromises with higher range faster fast charging things like four-wheel steer all because of a ground-up design. And I think everybody needs to also recognize that this platform is going to give us scalability that will lead to a cost advantage and a high degree of reuse. So I definitely think I'm very happy that we made those changes. And when you really get in and look at the organizational structure we already have a dedicated team that works on the whole EV propulsion system. We have a dedicated Vice President where all the EV programs all the chief engineers and all the EV programs report. We have EV Growth that looks at how we're going to go to market and has led the creation of the digital retail platform that we shared last year. We -- and part of the 2018 transformation that we did we pulled all the software together. And since that point in time so since 2018 early 2019 we have been -- had all that software together and I think that's what's allowed us to accelerate. And we started rolling out the vehicle intelligence platform which gives us pretty much over-the-air capability across the whole vehicle in 2019 and it's come out in every vehicle and now where they're taking that to the next level with Ultifi. So when you look at the structure of our company a lot of the key work that needs to be done to enable our EV success was put in place in 2018 2019 and 2020. And as we look across -- and I spend a lot of time talking to our employees across the whole organization and no matter what they're working on they're excited to be a part of our all-EV future. Let's remember at General Motors over 40% of our salaried employees and even higher percent of our technical talent has been with the company five years or less. And so they're here because of the mission for EVs. And we believe every single one of them is valuable and has an important role to play in our future EV whether they're working on EVs today or they work on seats or they work on software design or interior design all those things that exist in an EV as well. So I think the way we've really focused on what organizations need to be there. So we lead in EV execution with the scale and the high reuse that enables us to take time out of our EDP is where we're focused.Well so two components of that. First from a software perspective we've already rolled out VIP and we're already taking it to the next level with Ultifi which is going to really improve the speed at which we can make changes and make your product better as after you buy it then you can download or have over-the-air updates of features that didn't even exist when you bought the vehicle. So I think the mindset of agile quick and the vehicle just keeps getting better is well rooted in our software organization. And then when you look from an LTM perspective remember LTM is chemistry agnostic. We're working with many other companies and doing internal research that we will have -- to have the best battery chemistry and the LTM platform allows for that. It's upgradable. It even reads -- you can have variation within the platform. So I think there was a lot of work that went into how Ultium was designed to give it the plug-and-play and knowing that chemistry was going to keep changing and we needed to be agile because we can continue to work on taking cost out and improving energy density.So on the first question Dan Berce is on the line. So Dan do you want to take that one?Thanks Kyle.Great. Well thanks everybody. Paul and I and Kyle and Dan really appreciate all of your questions. As we move through this year I want to reiterate we're now in execution mode because we are â€“ we are building on the investments we made over the last several years with Ultium and with the products that we put together with the shortening of the VDP. And when we look going forward we have incredible momentum with the three battery plants between now and 2024 and another to be announced shortly as well as the conversion of four of our plants have either happened or happening in this time frame. So we're just going to keep keep executing and keep working toward our EV leadership goal. And I think we have a team that has demonstrated that we're going to capitalize on opportunities. We're going to solve challenges and work with our stakeholders across the company to do just that. That's our commitment to you and that's our commitment to our investors to really create value over the long term. And so I appreciate your commitment and thanks. I hope everybody has a great evening.,0.195834887,0.966830134,0.385497975

129,129,MPC,Hennigan:,Phil it's Mike. I just want to add that I've said many times that this business is predominantly a return of capital business and a return on capital business. And it's up to us to look at the opportunities that we have from a capital standpoint. I hope the market realizes that we're going to stay very disciplined looking for solid returns but we do want to grow earnings. But at the same time we feel strongly that return of capital is a major component of what we're trying to accomplish here.Paul it's Mike. First off thank you for your comment. It's a multipart question. So I'm going to start and I'll let Brian talk a little bit about structure but I'm going to repeat a little bit of what I said earlier right? I know everybody likes that metric of capture and if it wasn't for Kristina I probably would not be a fan of putting it out there but she keeps saying how important it is for everybody to see that metric. But there are so many things that play into that and one that doesn't normally occur to the extent that it's occurring now is the structure. And the backwardation that we've seen I mean if you look at the screen right now on distillate since we've talked a lot about distillate month one to month two backwardation is pretty strong especially for this time of year. We would never normally think along those lines. So that comes into play as we're moving products and I'll let Brian talk a little bit about it. He mentioned it earlier as far as a prompt barrel versus something that's got to travel on Colonial. And then Mayor mentioned earlier too is as flat price gets higher and higher you end up with this phenomenon where secondary products don't keep pace with flat price of crude and you end up with an impact there as well. So there's a lot of things hitting. And in this quarter particularly as Doug mentioned earlier it's a pretty volatile quarter. January versus February versus March was pretty sizable in volatility as to what we are seeing in the market. So anyway let me let Brian make a comment towards structure. If you want to add there Brian?Connor it's Mike. I'll start. First to your point geopolitical events always have an impact on supply and demand in the energy markets and we're seeing it now in the current situation with Russia and Ukraine. But if you go back in time much all geopolitical events tend to have some impact to energy. So that's an ongoing thing. The point you made about sustainability that's kind of in parallel to what's happening as well. So people are starting to think about how do they position the portfolios as we have and put out their goals in sustainability. We're very proud. We think we're leading in that area in certain regards. And at the same time that we're trying to supply the market because obviously it's a very tight inventory situation. And as Ray mentioned earlier we're pushing back some turnarounds. We're trying to maximize production as best we can in the short term. So I mean at the end of all this counter my word to the team all the time is let's worry about what we can control. There's a lot of things out there that we don't control and we stay attuned to them but we try and bring it back to what we do control. And in the short term what we do control is trying to maximize production into the marketplace. And that's what Ray and the team are trying to do.Yeah. Brian do you want to take that?Brian you want to take that?Theresa it's Mike. On the feedstock question what we said last time is we're going to provide more color on the dynamics around the feedstock and who does what et cetera. But we want to wait until we get the JV closed. We're hoping that is very shortly. As Ray mentioned we're very close on the permitting side. And then assuming that follows through then we'll get to close JV. And at that time we'll give a little bit more color on the feedstock dynamics.Brian do you want to start and I'll fish up.Jason it's Mike. I would just add obviously as sellers were trying to maximize the pump and as buyers people are trying to buy down the curve as a general rule. So you have that yin and yang going on. And like Brian said every situation is unique. But backward markets tell you that you have tight inventories. That's ultimately what backwardation is all about. It says that inventories are tight and product availability is tight. With respect to your second question yeah we're not going to speculate out in time with Neste but I will tell you that the effort to get to this partnership was long. And the team Dave Heppner headed it up inside our shop here and worked with the Neste Group for a long period of time. And one of the biggest things that I believe is important as a result of it was the mutual respect each company have for each other and common goals that were setting for each other. So I think it is a nice platform for us to continue to look for ways that we can do business together. And that was really important for us as we were working through this very similar to when we've entered other partnerships. One of the things that's most important to us is will the partnership endure the test of time. JVs are difficult in general and you need to be really comfortable at the start of a JV that you feel that you have the right partner. And we feel that way with Neste with respect to Martinez.,0.002515157,0.002731144,0.000156002
130,130,NSC,Shaw:,Go ahead. I'm sorry Cindy.Thank you.Hi good morning Brian. Thanks for the question. I'm going to start with that and then turn it over to Cindy. And just to be crystal clear restoring service is the top priority of this entire leadership and every employee at Norfolk Southern. Personally I've been out in the field and I've been in our dispatch center and I really see the pride that our employees have in serving our customers and serving our -- serving the US economy. I'm really encouraged by the employee engagement and I'm very encouraged about the steps that we're taking right now to restore our service product to where it needs to be.And you couple that with the implementation of TOP SPG late this quarter and a number of other specific tactical initiatives that Cindy has every day to improve the quality of our service and our labor utilization. We've got a good runway ahead of us.Thanks Brian.Cindy I think we think of it as a process of continual improvement.Thanks Ken. With respect to how we're approaching this thing I mean to be clear our first priority is restoring our service. And our entire organization laser focused on delivering that objective. Once we've gotten that near-term goal we are going to perform a retrospective analysis on how we got into this position. And we're going to understand what signals we missed how we can improve the process and what mitigates we can put in place going forward. For us we firmly believe that right now it's a combination of our employee level and our service plan which is why we very quickly implemented decisively initiatives to increase our hiring and to redesign our operating plan. That redesign of the operating plan is going to improve our balance it's going to improve the simplicity of our product and it's going to improve the executability of our product which is going to help the service product in all three of our franchises. Ed do you want to talk specifically about international intermodal?Thank you Ken.Yeah. Thank you for the question. We believe that not only is the US economy poised to continue to deliver growth for transportation providers who can add value but we think that the consumer demand is going to continue here at least for the foreseeable future. And you layer in some high commodity prices and some geopolitical conflict. And we believe that the US is very well-positioned in the current environment despite some of those headwinds that we all know about in terms of rate increases and higher fuel prices. That being said we know that as we improve our service as we deliver more capacity that our customers want to grow they're poised to grow and we're going to be able to deliver that growth. So yes I would say we're sticking with our view that we're going to be able to deliver growth for the full year in terms of volume.Yeah Walter that's part of that is a hypothetical as to what form could potentially take. I can tell you that we are completely aligned with our customers and our shareholders and our regulators on the intent and the focus on delivering value to our customers. And we have every economic incentive and are self-motivated to fix this problem. And as a result we are staying actively engaged with the STB. You saw Ed and Cindy and Annie represent Norfolk Southern in the industry yesterday in that venue. And I think what you heard from them is that we are entirely focused on restoring our service levels. That's our commitment.Tom there's a dual path here right? At the same time we're implementing TOP SPG. We're going to start getting healthier with our crew base. And I'm very confident in the ability of our team out in the field to execute this.Cindy I would add that as we strike balance we strike simplicity and we add crews our train performance is going to improve. Train speed is going to improve. The quality of our product is going to improve and that's going to add more business to existing trades. And so just from that standpoint even without a design change we're going to add train length and train weight.Sure. I'll comment on that. We've taken a very hard look at our effectiveness in terms of throughput efficiency and our ability to deliver capacity for the market through our terminals. And in many cases there's a lot of inflation working its way through the entire US economy that manifests itself of course at the terminal level as well. But what we are focused on is ensuring number one that we have the capability at the terminal level to handle the volumes that TOP SPG is going to deliver for us going forward. We are reconfiguring some of those contracts as we speak to both make sure that we have that capacity for the future as well as ensure that the type of operation that we have is the one that we need. So we're working on that as we speak and we're confident that as TOP SPG rolls out here we're going to see it manifest itself as additional capacity for our customers and improved executability for the service we deliver. And the physical capacity of our intermodal footprint has allowed us to handle much higher intermodal volumes just as recently as 2018.Well there's probably very little I can talk about any of those things. But let me say this we are blessed with a fantastic portfolio of customers. The customer you're talking about is a very valued partner of ours including some others. And they are positioning themselves for growth. Our customers want to grow they are poised to grow. They're investing for growth and we are too. And so you put the combination of very powerful intermodal franchise. We would argue the best certainly in the Eastern United States put that together with a robust portfolio of partners who are delivering value for their customers in the marketplace. And I think it's already a great combination. It can only get stronger.Thank you for your time and your questions and I appreciate you joining our call this morning.,0.003126204,0.003446698,0.000267377
131,131,MRVL,Murphy:,Yes. Great question Blayne on storage. So a couple of things. So on the SSD side yes that's actually multiple DIY programs now. Those are kicking in in various end markets and we see that trend being obviously way up year-over-year this year but growing strongly into next year. So I think that strategy to really work closely with some of these system-level OEMs whether itâ€™d be in the cloud or other applications. It's a pretty compelling business model. So that one is going well. On the cloud or on the nearline side yes I mean I think if you just look at the performance of these large cloud properties and how they're performing in terms of their own revenue growth. There's certainly a scaling that goes on with the storage. So the need for increase capacity in cold storage continues. We're well-positioned with that with our controllers and our preamplifiers actually which is a new revenue stream for us as well. So that's still continuing and that's very strong. And then finally the fiber channel it was one of our most stable businesses Blayne going back even when Cavium owned it even when it was QLogic. It certainly have a lot of choppiness this year with manufacturing supply disruptions in Southeast Asia. That's started to stabilize. Actually fiber channel grew quarter-over-quarter and will continue to get better. And we hope that that will - just by design that should be a much more stable business. So yes overall just I think you've heard in my remarks I mean we're just - it's been a journey on the storage side and I've just got to thank our entire team for fundamentally transforming a business which if you go back 5 years ago when I showed up and this wasn't just me the whole management team this was a business that was highly concentrated HDD controllers only selling all into 2.5-inch notebooks okay? And that was sort of the story and the melting ice cube people were worried about. And so I'm very proud of the team when I fast forward 5 years and we've now got greater than 60% of our storage business in data center and these high-performance applications and then really the bulk of the balance being in very sticky stable markets. And the exposure to things like notebooks being deminimis I think it's been a great transformation story. And the fact that we're having calls talking about our storage business growing double digits and continuing to do that is great effort. And by the way we're not milking this business either. I mean we've been very aggressive to move our platform to 5-nanometer which effectively jumped at least a node for most people probably for most people with 2 or 3 nodes. But for these high-performance applications Blayne especially in the data center you get tremendous power savings by doing this. So that's going to be a first step into a broader platform of products in storage as well as in our traditional networking businesses like processors and switch chips.Yes. Great questions. So just quickly on the first one. Actually we're - I'm pretty excited about moving to the end market reporting. I think it's going to give investors a much growth drivers. It actually reflects how we think about allocating the capital of the company. I mean I've actually managed the company from a market-based philosophy from the very beginning. And so to now be able to show you our data center business there's also peers that report those numbers so it will give investors a sense of our relative growth rates. And then carrier you can capture our 5G anyway. So I think that will be a real positive thing for everybody. On the networking side it's interesting Ross that individually some of these businesses are inherently lumpy. I mean I think we all know that the carrier telecom-type businesses tend to be lumpier than others. That being said when you blend actually our combined networking businesses across things like enterprise and carrier and even right now automotive is reported in our networking actually from an end demand standpoint you do get a smoother profile which has all been up into the right by the way. I think in the last year the dynamic on the quarterly moves has been more supply related than it has been just 'Hey networking was up and then everybody kind of slowed down together and everybody is up. Actually business has been very strong Ross since last year. If you recall we started growing the company double digits year-over-year in Q2 of last year. So we've been on this double-digit growth rate. Now we're - it's actually accelerating. And during this time frame if we could get more supply it would probably look a lot - look smoother if you will. But I think you're right to integrate it over maybe a few quarter period first half second half or even one-year period to get the full view just because the manufacturing cycle times of some of these products can be several quarters. So if you get upside there's a time to react. But no if you just sort of blended end demand Ross you'd see a very steady increase. And the nice thing is we have a very diversified business in networking. So it's spread across all these end markets as I mentioned.Sure Ambrish. I mean I would say both in the relative near term okay and over the next several years. I actually break it into three phases. There's the sort of second half of this year looking into next year and the year after and then I would say out a few years beyond that. I think - and I didn't quite answer Ross' question but I'll weave it in here. This last one was what do you see in the second half? So in networking for example I mean we have the 5G ramp for us will pick up will accelerate. That's primarily due to increased adoption in the United States and deployments there plus design wins that we have won several years ago ramping into production. You've got a very strong Marvell business in the cloud with our SmartNIC product line that's been growing very very nicely and will continue in the second half. I'm surprised no one asked the question about Inphi yet but we're very pleased to guide 215 for Inphi in Q2 which is I think well above what anybody thought. That business is also going to continue to accelerate in the second half both on the intra-data center business in PAM4 as well as the 400ZR ramp which we think will be meaningful next year but also starting this year. And then finally as I mentioned the Ethernet switch and PHY business you could also throw automotive in there. I mean we got almost all of these growth drivers we mentioned continue. So that's right in front of us. I think what I get very excited about as you alluded to is the design win momentum in the company has been extremely strong. And probably - not probably as strong as I've ever seen it in the past five years I've been here and any kind of prior record I could find. And those are things that as we noted in my remarks would be designs we win now that would ramp up starting probably in calendar 2023 2024 and then go beyond that and that's also you would - you should kind of tie it together with that was when our 5-nanometer platform will be really in full production across multiple end customers end markets and end applications. So that's one that kind of layers on top of all of this and candidly would extend beyond what we talked about at the last Investor Day. So I think if you draw a line between here and there there's all kinds of goodness in different areas Ambrish but I think we're feeling really good about the investments we made. I think the acquisitions that we did positioned us really well and they fit together in their own way. And I think - and finally I would say that the customer go-to-market our brand promise to our customers the way we engage the way we partner resonates really well in this environment. And we're just - we're viewed as a very credible and reliable partner with scale now especially with Inphi and to really deliver the most complex critical products that our customers need.Yes. This is just Marvell standalone. So all those comments on largest sort of design type win achievement we've seen plus the funnel that's all from the organic Marvell business okay? Starting next quarter we're going to have the Inphi team in our results and in our internal results in terms of our design win funnel and momentum. But yes they've done a great job too. I mean that's the whole other story. But I'm just saying standalone Marvell with our 5-nanometer platform and our 5G cloud strategy automotive all the things we articulated at the Investor Day pre-Inphi that's all tracking the in line or better than we thought.Yes. Thanks Harlan. No I think we are - to start maybe at the end first. We're in the early innings of both these upgrade cycles. I think your commentary overall is right. Both of those are accelerating. On the PAM side I would say probably by the end of '23 certainly if you draw a line between now and the end of - I'm sorry calendar '22 our fiscal '23 you'll see most of this conversion from these legacy NRZ solutions move over. And that's still a decent amount of the connections today. So there's a big lift between now and then. That's pretty exciting. And then of course you've got other hyperscalers around the world outside the US. On 400 ZR that is also just at the beginning phases. I think that's going to be much more broad obviously than COLORZ was which was 100 gig and it was really for one customer. And that is - both of those we have strong backlog bookings visibility heads down to plan the supply and to plan the ramp. So those are very much intact which was really part of our deal thesis for doing it in the first place.Sure. Yes. No I think in general the 5G momentum is quite strong. I think obviously you saw the impact on people last year with China which was very meaningful. And that will by the way over time we're debating is it second half or when is it? But those deployments will obviously continue. They're not done. Then the U.S. is really I think where we're going to see a lot of traction this year. India is a little more unclear. I think the latest is certainly trials will be conducted at the end of this year. Candidly I think with impact of COVID-19 in the country that's probably delayed things. We saw that last year. If you remember there was supposed to be a much larger U.S. build-out and COVID delayed that. We're watching that. But no I think overall it's been a very meaningful technology transition. And so we were - we think that's going to be very broad. We've still got a ways to go to be honest with you. There's a lot in front of us relative to getting to full run rate with the full platform at our two lead OEMs. In one case we have the platform but they're really ramping their business based on their geographies that they participate in. And then with our second customer those chips are still - a lot of those are in development although our first products are ramping very nicely and we're pleased to see that both those companies are participating very actively in the global 5G rollouts. So that was all positive. And yes - and then by the way I mean even with China stays flat as I mentioned it's - we do see a very strong second half for our 5G business. And we just came off our seventh quarter in a row of growing that business sequentially. So it's been a real tailwind for us. I did want to just make one comment before we move to the next question. I actually misspoke earlier there was a question about fiber channel. And I think it was Ross about it being lumpy. So I had my quarters off. So it was down - fiber channel was down in Q1. That was part of the lumpy down. It's going to be up in Q2 and then we anticipate it - unless there's some other disruptions that should be a generally flat business going forward. And obviously in the scheme of things in the combined company I don't - and reported by end market I don't anticipate we're going to be having lots of discussions about fiber channel anymore. But if something happens we'll let you guys know.Yes. Gary I'll take the first one. I think it's - I think you're just highlighting a very important reminder for everybody on this call who I believe probably everybody here is calling in from the United States where things are opening up and things are feeling like they're getting back to normal. And as you point out we're monitoring very closely the situation not only in Taiwan. Obviously we don't have production in India but many chip companies have significant India operations in terms of R&D. You've got other countries in Southeast Asia that are having outbreaks. Malaysia would be one. So we're watching this very very closely. It's been just an unprecedented year between weather and the virus on the supply chain. But we're watching it and that's - we've comprehended as much as we could on any of these things into our guidance. We do that every quarter. But certainly it's a dynamic situation. I mean we had a water issue in Taiwan recently. I guess with the recent improvement there some of that's backed off. So yes it's something we've got to watch and manage very dynamically Gary but we've comprehended all of that in our outlook. Jean do you want to answer the second question?Yes great. Thanks Quinn. Yes on the first one yes certainly we have as I mentioned line of sight on our supply through the end of the year and encouraged by what we're seeing also for next year as well. Look lead times are very extended for everybody at this point. Weâ€™ve asked our customers for significant backlog to - and not only the backlog but really the detailed discussion behind the backlog relative to what are the drivers how much of it is for buffer or how much do you have now what are your plans so we can get better line of sight to allocate the material. And we've also worked with many of them and are in the process of doing that to really firm up those orders relative to their ability to reschedule and cancel them but we're giving them time to figure that out. So I think that's been a healthy exercise but lead times are not coming down. They're extended not because we want to keep them extended but the supply chain given the - just the volume on it there's just queues and you just have to make sure you plan for that. And then on the data center side we certainly have many of the key pieces if not almost all the key pieces to really be a big player in the cloud infrastructure side with our ASICs with the PAM products you mentioned I mean O-RAN all kinds of things. On the switch side it's an interesting discussion because we're very aggressively promoting and developing a co-packaged optics solution that will be very much open source for the industry. So we want to be an enabler of that. We think that's going to be a good thing whether somebody wants to do their own ASIC or co-package it with a partner. And that's a discussion that we're having. I think we're encouraged because when you look at our - and I noted in my comments we introduced about 18 months ago our multi-terabit Switch family where just as - for a reminder these are at 3.2 6.4 and 12.8 terabits per second. It's a modular design architecture. Now it's fully featured which has its advantages in many applications because that's really what customers want. On the other hand there's a lot of optimization you can do if you really want to do a high-end switch for just speeds and feeds. And I think everything is on the table in terms of looking at all that in the context of Inphi coming in in particular. And those are just some very active discussions we're having. But the roadmap notwithstanding we're extremely pleased with this high-end platform that we announced it's done really well in the market revenues ramping significantly and it's going to have a very good year next year and beyond. So I think that was a good investment that we made. And that really positioned us Quinn as a full provider from SMB switches to enterprise and campus which is core in aggregation all the way into the fully featured data center type applications. So it would be logical for us to consider broadening the portfolio there.Yes that's right Jean. And I mean I think the bigger picture Srini on the first one is just the blend of these two businesses are growing around 20% a year on networking kind of plus right. So it's a very strong performance. And I noted the issues earlier on our side. On ARM it really is a trend that's been happening. We certainly have a lot of capability in this area. There's a lot of confidentiality around this market. I can't really comment on us or the other people because I think it's also a little dangerous at times to talk about things. Is it a development type of opportunity? Is it a real production thing? So I think we - and our pivot and our business model last year was really to move this business from being one where in a lot of ways our Thunder product line really was a prototype type of capability that we enabled the whole industry on. But in the end what we found is nobody actually wanted to buy the standard products. So we're very pleased with the pivot we made. We have - we believe the best set of IP true ability to stitch together these very large high-end complex processors. I mean if you think about the things that we're doing for 5G or for networking or even what we built on Thunder we have a second to none capability there. And you should just assume that we're very active in this market but in a different kind of a business model where we engage directly with these customers there's an NRE type of arrangement. We build them exactly what they want. And the use cases and the benefits of moving to ARM are significant. And I think publicly it's out there the instances that are being moved more and more with an AWS platform to Graviton which is their own we obviously don't participate in that but it's just a great proof point for the industry. It's real and it's happening ARM and infrastructure and we're - our view is we would be the leading company for anyone to talk to about not only be able to design the chip and productize it but then to supply it in the kind of volumes that's required. It's - that's a key part of the equation now.Sure. Yes Chris. Thanks for the question. As I noted earlier we've been growing this company double-digits since a year ago and it's only accelerating. And as we've done that that's been great but candidly we haven't made a real dent in the delinquency. And in fact I think our business momentum is growing but I think the demands on us are growing even faster than our supply. So we're working hard on it. But I would say anybody that tells you in this industry that they know when this is going to get better like hey it's going to happen in a quarter. It's going to - I don't think that you're probably getting a realistic answer is my view. I think it's very dynamic. It's unprecedented. And at this point there are so many industries that are up and to the right and everybody is clamoring for product that - but we're working on it. And like I said we're the type of company Chris that I think we're more focused on the long-term slow and steady keep cranking it out every quarter keep blocking and tackling through this time period and keep making sure our customer are up. And then on your second question no we are ensuring that we have protection and not only protection but I would say mutual commitment with our customers around the supply. So we do have a large portion of our backlog which is only getting more to be honest that is non-cancelable. We are being somewhat flexible around building in some reschedule capability. Maybe you can do it once. And we're trying to work with our customers on this but we're having to make commitments especially with the growth that we see in front of us which I'm very comfortable doing but I also want to have the backstop of my customers. And this environment has created a dynamic where pretty much the CEO level at all of our major accounts they're willing to engage in this type of discussion activate their materials teams and get everybody together so that we can plan this thing as a combined team a Marvell team and a customer team versus two independent entities doing their own thing and the era of customers being secretive about their volumes or hiding the ball or not one you're doing just in time that's kind of all out the window at this point. And so the visibility is pretty good that we're getting but we are ensuring that we - when we're making commitments we've got some backstop from the customers that want the product.Yes. Well Harsh all of your wishes are going to come true next quarter because we're going to break out for you in detail the data center business of Marvell which is going to have the cloud in it. We're going to break up the carrier which you'll be able - we'll build it. And we'll talk to all of these by the way right? So you'll be able to get a sense of the moving pieces of 5G. We're going to have an auto industrial which is - obviously the big growth there is going to come from the automotive. And then our enterprise networking which I think is a great proxy as well. So I think we're going to give you what you want and we're going to give you seven quarters of history and we're going to guide it. Okay. So you'll be like a kid in a candy store. And then on the second question on Nokia yes that's still ramping. You've heard their commentary. They're ramping up. We're kind of replacing their legacy solutions within their - they have their recharge portfolio. We're part of that. They talk openly about sort of replacing FPGAs with recharge. So we're just part of that growth. And then of course we've got future opportunities where we're going to intersect with them with new sockets over time. So that's still in a ramp phase though. It's still early.,0.099694057,0.991613746,0.282312759
132,132,EMR,Krishnan:,Yes. I think the 2 software businesses GSS and OSI had a very very good first quarter from an -- orders remain very strong. OSI remains on plan. I think the other point is from a sales growth perspective which is the number you touted in I think we were up 2% on systems and solutions. And primarily that was driven by electronic shortages in our systems business our DeltaV business. Orders frankly were strong double digits. So we are seeing good momentum from an order activity as it relates to our systems businesses both the businesses that we're contributing as well as the ones that will remain within Emerson.Yes. I think Andrew as you probably heard at the AHRI I mean at this point all of our customers are telling us do not slow down. Fundamentally they have immediate demand that we are continuing to satisfy. They're building in safety stock for what will traditionally be a big third quarter in the industry. And more importantly they want to build up into fourth quarter in advance of the transition that's going to happen Jan 1. So at this point I think the messaging is do not slow down and we will continue to see good order activity from our customers over the course of the next few quarters here in preparation for that. I don't think there's going to be a significant inventory build before the transition but I think demand will not slow down in the fourth quarter like it traditionally does.No I think well said. I mean at this point the number is holding flat at 6.5% but we could tell you that the pace of FIDs or final investment decisions continue to improve just given the nature of the spend we're seeing with our customers. So we'll see that unravel over the next several quarters.Great question Markus. This is Ram here. So I think the short answer is we're doing both. I think the immediate need as we wrestle through component shortages is redesigning to ensure that we have component availability to meet current shipments. However in the Automation Solutions business particularly where we have the biggest exposure to electronics Mark Bulanda and his team are fundamentally redesigning all of the major platforms across automation solutions into next-generation platforms that are fundamentally enhanced performance use more modernized electronic components upgrading the chips obviously putting more diagnostics and additional functionality into those platforms. And we're using this opportunity to invest in next-generation platforms that will address what you referenced better cost better performance and frankly give us more robustness in our supply network design in order to support these products. Now as you know that will take a little longer but I think it's important to understand that we're remaining focused on both manage the short term with immediate redesigns but then invest in next-generation platforms going forward for the longer term.And just to add I think -- so as Lal described I think overall our Automation Solutions businesses remain very robust in China and I think we expect that to continue. If there's any semblance of a slowdown in China we've seen it in our appliance businesses related businesses where we supply sensors. And then our air conditioning business did see a soft first quarter flat demand if you will. However that's where the stimulus and the China stimulating their economy will help in the second half because we expect that to have an impact on our consumer-related businesses. So just to summarize China strong automation solutions expect that to continue and then we'll wait to see how the stimulus drives fundamental demand in our Climate Technologies business.Yes. And I think to your point in terms of the broader scope of technology whether it's continuous emission monitoring analytical systems that Lal showed in as an example or the relief valves or other isolation valving associated with emissions monitoring. We've got a very very good scope of products that can help our customers and we're certainly seeing a nice uptick on all those product lines as it relates to these type of investments for our customers.Okay. Yes. This is Ram Jeff. First off from an inflation perspective you're right U.S. inflation is probably the biggest portion of the inflation but we have seen inflation in Mexico as well. Mexico frankly Jan 1 they increased minimum wage entry-level wage by 22%. And frankly this is 1 of 4 minimum wage increases we've seen in Mexico since 2019. So there's issues outside of the U.S. as well but majority of the inflation is in the U.S. And in our larger compressor plant for example we've seen wage inflation particularly entry-level wages go up by 20% to 25% over a couple of steps. We've had to do that to remain competitive and have the labor availability to work down our backlog. So that's the extent. Normal inflation in some of the other markets we operate China inflation India inflation Europe inflation. Nothing abnormal normal levels of inflation in those markets. So the abnormal levels we're seeing are particularly in the U.S. and some Mexico.DL is about 9 -- high single digits...,0.003049731,0.003755152,0.000500312
133,133,DXCM,Sayer:,Larry thanks for asking. Letâ€™s go back a little bit on G7. Remember this is a global launch for us not just a U.S. one. Our limited launch right now in the UK is going on. We have seen mark there. UK will be our first launch as we roll out internationally. And then we roll out to other countries after that as we go through the local approval and filing process. So we are on track with our international plans. One of the things we have learned over the years is we really donâ€™t give dates as far as when we think things are going to be approved. And we are in our back and forth time with the FDA. We applaud them for spending as much time as they have an effort doing a busy time with us in getting this done. And we are confident we will have a meaningful U.S. launch of G7 this year. Approval more than likely will come after ADA as knowing what we know and what we see today. And we are comfortable with that. We are also comfortable that there are no showstoppers in the things we are discussing with them. We are having a very good dialogue and look forward to that launch. As far as a bolus with G7 you are absolutely right we do believe this is going to be a great product launch for us and will lead to more people using CGM. I think itâ€™s important that everybody remember we are in a different time now with respect to reimbursement particularly with the time it will take to get this into the pharmacy channel. So as you start lining things up once you have approval you file with CMS to get reimbursement that takes some time and the pharmacy contracts take some time. So we will launch the product and absolutely seek to get reimbursement and approval every place we can as quick as we can and even some prelaunch where we can do that. We have those efforts going on as well. So this will roll out as quickly as we can do it. We are optimistic we will get approved but more than likely after ADA.Yes. This is Kevin. I will take that. Our first users in the BELL countries this is all an e-commerce effort. This has been an e-commerce platform with some advertising from us. But by and large our e-commerce platform has reached these people. Thatâ€™s how they have heard about it and have paid cash for this product on their own. As far as positioning right now DexCom ONE is positioned for insulin users but itâ€™s not positioned for those who are going to integrate with another device or even share data with others. Itâ€™s a simplified version of our product for that type of use. In the other countries that we rolled out as Jereme said earlier we are involved in the tender process. In Spain we have reimbursement for DexCom ONE in Spain. In many of the European markets there is a positioning of what you would call high-risk pool and then another pool of insulin using patients. We have always played very well on the high-risk pool with these patients because of our connectivity our accuracy and our performance. And that is a higher price point within those geographies as well. With DexCom ONE we now have access to the other patients. And again the qualification of those patients varies tender-to-tender and country-to-country. But it gives us a much larger playing field â€“ our playing field is going to be expanded anywhere between 80% and 90% in some of these countries where we launched DexCom ONE is a dual product. So thatâ€™s there thatâ€™s why we are doing it and thatâ€™s what we believe. So expanding into new geographies with the product with the e-commerce platform but also expanding our reach and making available to more people.Yes. This is Kevin. I will take that. Obviously we are getting very good coverage in that segment. That population again Medicare covers that and that is really our fastest-growing patient segment right now. We are doing very well in these Type 2 patients. Hence the reason for expansion of the sales force and calling on more primary care physicians. As far as penetration in that population their needs for CGM data are equal to those in our Type 1 population and we believe not only is CGM going to be successful there but we will be successful there with our pump partners as well through our integrated systems. So I â€“ many years ago I have said 80% penetration for CGM in the Type 1 world and even people from our own company kind of gave me a funny look. I donâ€™t see that as being a problem over time. If you are going to be intensively using insulin there is no reason to not treat yourself with CGM. It is just a much better tool. So I believe that penetration get every bit as high as the Type 1 population without any question.Thank you for the question. This is definitely a passion of mine going way back to my early days in diabetes therapy back in â€˜90s. One of the things we have done this year we have hired a General Manager for our hospital business a very experienced executive who spent a lot of time here and we are starting to build a full team around him in that organization. We are running clinical studies right now to show how the product performs in the hospital environment. And we have had numerous discussions with the FDA. I think for us the key here is to get the sensing technology and the performance of the sensor validated and verified that it will be approved and usable in that environment. And the feedback we have gotten certainly during the pandemic has been very very positive for those facilities that did use CGM. Once we do that and validate the product performance just from a technical perspective then it becomes a question of what does that product look like what does it connect to and what is the distribution channel and business model look like. And thatâ€™s why we have an experienced GM in the team built out here. We know how much better things work in a hospital if you have continuous data. I have had several experiences where people have told me about having their fingers stuck every 30 minutes without diabetes in a post-surgical order in an ICU and it drives them crazy when they know they could be on CGM. As you look at the number of hospitalizations and the number of people hospitalized with diabetes and cardiovascular awards in particular the CGM opportunity here is vast. The questions we need to answer business model product configuration ease of use outcomes all those things. And we have a great team that can put that data together for us. So we are very optimistic and bullish about it over time. I do appreciate the question. Hopefully we will have you some more information over the course of the year.Yes. This is Kevin. I absolutely do. We appreciate all of you for hanging with us today. Obviously to say things have been a little hectic here would be an understatement. But as always we get through it. I just â€“ if you look at this quarter again $110 million in organic growth volume increases in the low-40% great new patient numbers post the Omicron care. DexCom ONE launched in Spain launch announced in the UK. CE Mark for G7 limited launch for G7 in the UK continued G7 progress in the U.S. continued scale in our business positive momentum on the operating leverage side. There is not a whole lot more we could do. Times cannot be better and more hectic they are at DexCom right now. We appreciate everybodyâ€™s support and all the fine people who make this possible. Thanks everybody and have a great day.,0.004345596,0.008939207,0.002654632
134,134,CCI,Brown:,Yeah. On your second question Jon around...I'm sorry did you want to ask Dan another question on that?No worry. Good morning Jon. On your second question around what we're seeing from a fiber solution standpoint we continue to think that we'll grow that business in and around that 3% level on a year-over-year basis. We've seen good opportunities in the space and feel like the team has done a great job continuing to run that business well. And it creates a great base of assets as we've seen for us to be able to add small cells to those assets. And so back to my comments earlier around the way that we think about capital spending that fiber investment that we've made both in terms of acquisitions as well as what we've built is based on what we believe will be future lease-up for small cells. And the activity that we've won thus far as well as activity that we see the carriers investigating that will lead to future business we believe looks like the assets are really well positioned for that. So business is performing well and the opportunity for lease-up is intact.There's nothing to call out in the quarter or that we believe will be in the guide for 2022.Generally speaking the prepaid rent would be received in and around when they're installed. So when we're counting them as on-air and the metrics that we're giving you the prepaid rent would come in commensurate with that. In terms of how we structure the recent agreements and what we're seeing we haven't seen any change in the pricing of the way that we've transacted with carriers. Keep in mind that generally these things are priced on a return basis and we've seen the pricing hold. Over the many years that we've been in the business now the pricing in the new nodes that we've recently contracted is consistent with that.You bet.Sure. Thanks for the questions Mike. On your first question I think the activity as it has historically whenever there's an upgrade to a new technology it tends to -- the dollars tend to be spent in the areas that are the most densely populated in the US first. And we've certainly seen that trend in -- as 5G has started to be deployed. I think that's one of the reasons why we have industry-leading tower revenue growth at 6%. I also think it's indicative of what we're going to see on the small cell side. The vast majority of the investment that we've made in fiber and small cells has been in those top 30 markets in the US. It's the locations where we believe the vast majority of the capital will be going for the densification efforts at least in the near to medium-term. And over the long-term we think those assets much like towers have in those urban areas the investment will skew towards that urban activity and future densification. So some of the best assets are in those dense urban areas. We think we'll see a similar thing with fiber and small cells that we've seen historically with towers and are experiencing as we move into 5G already with the tower footprint. On your second question we certainly believe that there's an opportunity around edge data centers and have positioned ourselves several years ago with our investment in vapor to take advantage of that opportunity. I would put that in the category of -- that's an upside case for us. If data traffic gets to the point where edge data centers become a meaningful component of the overall wireless network an upside case in our investment in small cells and fiber. We did not underwrite that in our base case nor are we underwriting it day to day as we invest in fiber and small cells. But if you're a believer that ultimately there's going to be so much data traffic in the network that these metro data centers or edge data centers are going to be necessary for wireless. We're going to be in the upside outcomes for our small cells and fiber. And so we're certainly positioned well for that opportunity. And I would say today it seems more probable that that's a likely outcome than what we would have said several years ago but it's not in our base case underwrite as we think about what the growth and returns will be on the assets. But there are certainly some signs as referenced earlier in some of the questions -- in the question around fixed wireless that would suggest maybe that opportunity is growing and becoming more likely. And I would start first with the benefit we're going to get out of fiber and small cells as a result of that. And I think we're really well positioned vis-Ã -vis the fiber and our investment in Vapor to benefit if we get all the way to the upside cases where these edge data centers are necessary and critical components for the wireless networks.Phil as we think about any given year and I think we've talked about some on the call as we've tried to point to some of the one-time items in the first quarter. And we think about the guidance and the outlook on an annual year-over-year basis because we think it's the best way to look at the business. As we get further into the back half of the year maybe we can be a little bit more descriptive about the ramp in activity and what we're seeing is falling into the first half versus the second half of the year. But in general this is shaping up to be a pretty normal year in terms of the way the activity is loaded into a calendar year. I don't want to really get into giving guidance for 2023. And we typically or historically have done that in October and we would expect to do that again this year. So we're two calls away from giving you an outlook for 2023.Sami there's always some of this activity that we're doing that will fall outside of the MLA structures. We talked about this a little bit last quarter. The carriers historically as we worked with them will give us a base level of commitment of areas that they know for sure that they're going to deploy but there's always activity -- has been historically always activity that has fallen beyond and outside of those agreements. So probably not going to get to the place where we reconcile that down to the agreements versus what we're actually seeing. But there is activity that falls outside of that both in the tower business the small cell business as well as the services business. So we have more activity than we contemplated as we talked about that's continued to grow as we've gone into this calendar year and excited about what the implications are to our results for the year.I think I want to be careful. Again we'll talk about 2023 guidance as we get into October. Broadly though if you look at what's happening in terms of demand for 5G networks the devices being available and the way consumers are using them the benefit of lower latency and higher speeds are driving more traffic. And we think that is a trend that we will see continue for multi-years into the future. And it's what gives us confidence that our 7% to 8% growth in the dividend is going to continue for periods beyond just the near-term. So we think we've positioned ourselves in a place where we own the assets that are going to be necessary for that 5G deployment with both towers and small cells and certainly see opportunities that could drive beyond our 7% to 8% growth. But we'll wait until we get to those periods to start to give you more specific guidance around when and if that activity shows up.Your math is not wrong. We were elevated in the first quarter. Again we give the guidance on an annual basis based on the timing of certain things the ins and outs that happen over the course of the year. We mentioned last quarter that as a part of the -- some of the integration work we would expect about $10 million of churn in that business in the back half of the year. So that will have an impact on how the business runs for the balance of the year and will bring us back into a little bit lower. So that will be in the back half of -- we think it will be kind of mid-year or back half of the year as we spoke to last quarter. But all in all the business is performing as we would expect in and around that 3% growth. And importantly it becomes kind of a base of return and yield on that fiber asset that upon which we can add small cells. So proud of the team and how they've done managing the business. And most importantly in terms of what drives the return on that asset over the long term obviously the small cells have started to show up in significant scale and using that same fiber asset will drive the returns and the yield on the assets.I would say there are some opportunities where we can use our fiber as backbone for some of those builds that would go into places that would not be core to our business. We have seen some of those opportunities and have captured some of those. They're tangential really to the places where we would have fiber for government enterprise universities the kind of the core of our fiber solutions business or the places where we would typically be building small cells. But our network can be a backbone component of the build into more residential areas and we've seen some of those opportunities.On your first question the nodes that we'll put on air in 2022 and 2023 are a mix of anchor build and colocations. And we'll get into -- as time passes we'll continue to give you the CapEx update in both this calendar year and 2023. But I think for planning purposes you should think about as a mix of activity as what we have done historically. And we've talked about this in prior quarters but we would expect CapEx to ramp as we're ramping towards higher volume of activity. One other thing and I think you understand this Greg from the way you asked the question. But when we're talking about nodes we're not making -- we're not distinguishing nodes that are the anchor-build nodes versus the co-located node. We would refer to both those the initial node as well as the co-located node as a small cell node. So those 5 000 would be a mix of both anchor and co-located notes when we talked about 5 000 in 2022 and more than 10 000 in 2023. On your second question around the MLA structure and the activity that we're seeing that's probably a level of detail beyond what we want to go in terms of discussing the way customers are thinking about their builds and activity. Generally I refer to my prior comments around there's a significant amount of committed activity over multi-years that we have from our customers and we believe there will be activity beyond those committed levels that we'll see from the carriers as they build out their 5G networks. Operator let's take maybe one more question.Thanks for the questions David. I think I'd refer you to the comments that I made at the opening of the call. We're focused solely on the United States and the opportunities that we see in the US. We believe it has the most attractive growth profile in the world as well as the lowest risk. And for the reasons that we laid out at the beginning of the call we think the vast majority if not all of our investment will be allocated here in the US. The growth prospects as 5G years are being deployed are incredibly attractive and believe the returns from that investment of capital are just going to be terrific for shareholders. So we think it's the best place in the world to be putting capital and investment and believe that the dynamics of the US market because of that virtuous cycle that I was referring to. Consumers are willing to pay for it and the operators are continuing to invest the capital in greater ways and they have a lot of spectrum to continue to do that. So I think we're looking at multiyear growth in the US with lots of opportunities. So we're focusing the capital whether it be for builds or acquisitions we're focused solely in the US market.So thanks for the questions and thanks for everyone joining us. Did you have a follow-up? Thanks everyone for joining this call this morning. And just want to say thank you to our team who have done a terrific job as we launched off into 2022 here. Well done in the first quarter and look forward to catching up with all of you in the balance of the year. Talk soon.,0.003259261,0.004396439,0.000569169
135,135,PXD,Sheffield:,Yes. I mean I think that's the big sixty-four-dollar question. I mean as you know the strip drops on down to $70 after 5 years. On WTI in fact it's below $70 after 5 years. There's got to be a lot more. I think comfort that that strip is going to move up. I think it will long term instead of just marching forward. So we still -- I mean we had a lot of negative items around the world with Chinese lockdown inflation and we still had over $100 oil over the last 2 or 3 weeks. So -- and now we're seeing the potential ban on Russian crude and a phase-in between now and over the next 6 months and to the end of the year from EU. So things are going to get tighter. I still think it's going to go higher. And we have to decide obviously the intrinsic value at various price stacks of the company and when to obviously opportunistically buy back the stock. So we have the firepower and the balance sheet to do it.We have to realize we're already disbursing 80% of our -- our framework is all back toward the dividend. So it's 80% of our cash flow is going to the dividend. And so we're looking for people that won't stabilize dividends. So I mean over 5 years you're going to get over half the value of the market cap of the company back its dividends. And so at least you got something whenever the next downturn is in which it's not for a long time at least look back and say I've got half my stock price back in dividends that you can do whatever you want to. And that's the big benefit of dividends versus buying back stock.You got to realize Bob that we just announced the first unhedged paid dividend. And so it's -- we paid 4 quarters. It's barely creeped up. It was 6% last quarter. So ask me that question 4 quarters from now. If we're continuing at 12% to 13% I think you'll see -- we should not be trading in at 12% 13% yield. But you got to establish history. It's got to be -- it's got to continue. It's got to be -- so we're just now making the first -- in fact the payment is not going to be made until June. So let's get several quarters of payments in that 12% to 13% yield and see if we continue to trade where we're at on a yield basis. Looking at majors there's no reason why anybody should be buying a major oil company at a 4% to 5% yield versus buying Pioneer at 12% 13% yield. We're growing 5% a year at just as long as inventory better ROCE. And so just -- we have to reach out to that retail sector. We got to reach out to all those dividend funds. And we just got out on the road for the first time in the last 3 to 4 weeks. So give me about 12 months and we'll see where it ends up.Thanks.Again thanks. We appreciate everybody's Q&A and look forward to the next quarter and seeing everybody out on the road. Again thank you and everybody stay safe.,0.014809787,0.027125537,0.01231575
136,136,ROP,Blanton:,Doing more LNG projects to take gas to Europe would help you is that correct?Okay. Second question is regarding the $5 billion. Could you just reassure us that there are businesses out there to be acquired that are large enough? That are of the kind that Roper has traditionally purchased that are large enough to enable your growth to continue at the past rig for how long?And these are the same kinds of qualities that you've been able to acquire in the past.Okay thank you.,0.002967238,0.002967238,0
137,137,PH,Williams:,And it's Tom again. So yes we don't always have complete visibility but our backlog is increasing sequentially. North America went up 14% and international went up 6%. So that's part of it. We're also just recognizing that the second half we don't see -- significant improvement from supply chain. We think you'll get a little bit of most of those supply chain improvements will be more so into our FY '23. We have not been impacted a lot of that but I think the difference you're seeing between orders and organic growth is what I was referring to earlier as customers putting in orders and having it be over multi-quarters release dates whereas in the past they would give us orders that were much shorter cycle. These are longer cycle by industrial standards with release dates over multiple quarters.Good David it's Tom we could not be happier obviously because it has been sort of companies been working on for a long time on international margins. So I would say it's started a while even before the changes still wind strategy. At least in my watch it started with our team working very hard to change the cost structure in all international in particular in EMEA. And just recognizing that all those different countries and different infrastructures there was an opportunity to try to simplify that. So that's been going on for multiple years having a more agile lower cost structure than a concerted effort to grow international distribution from where we started at 35% -- at 35-65% split. Now to 40 and we'll give you the latest when we get to Investor Day but it's north of 40 now so you getting some mix help there. We've had -- Asia is always historically been a very strong performer. We really kind of set that region up that we think you can think about over the last 30 years we set that region up. The latest and so we took all the best practices that we had from everywhere around the world when we set that region up from a cost structure standpoint. But what's helped us a lot the last couple of years is the Europe team and Latin America being small for us but both of those teams have made a marked improvement. And when we think going forward your other part of your question David we see no reason why they can't continue. We'll give you new targets when we get to March. But you see right now our full-year guide. basically North America international margins conversion. We had always hoped that they be basically the same. And so going forward we don't see any reason why they can't be and they both have equal opportunity to grow to higher levels and we'll give you that vision in March.As so just for clarification the back half organic is 6%. You have about 1% currency headwind. So probably net's to around 5. And there is some -- we're being what I mentioned earlier pragmatic about the uncertainties on supply chain or so on our customers. But then we're not immune. We have some of our own challenges. But I think our team has done a particular job weathering it. And probably the best evidence of our ability to weather supply chain is just our ability at the MROS because if you're struggling with your supply chain initiative will it ultimately shows up in your marginal return on sales but that's how I'd characterize the second half.This is Thomas. Hard to quantify if you take the orders and try to some how dissect and separate all of the ones that are multi-quarters I'd be hazard and just a guess I don't think it's material. It just -- it's different as far as in the past at least on industrial and normal business conditions say normal supply chains and normal order entry patterns you had a fairly consistent input-output quarter-to-quarter maybe a little bit going into the next quarter. This is clearly more over multi-quarters. And actually it's good it's customers trying to plan for longer trying to make sure they get their ticket in line and in a way that help us from a plans point. So when things do stabilize if they continue that way I think that's a good thing for scheduling our factors and scheduling our supply chain.Nigel it's Tom. So on military OEMs and that's one we mentioned in the last call we do see that being slightly solved mid-single-digit's decline. And that's primarily because of the repositioning that our customers thankfully did to try to strengthen the supply chain and protect the supply-chain during the pandemic. They didn't want people to go wonder. And so they kind of pull forward demand into last fiscal year leaving this fiscal year lighter. As you're adjusting inventory. So that should come back into FY '23 and beyond. And I would see that being a lower to mid-single bit. Probably more towards a low-single-digit growth on the military OE side. And then our military MRO we had some softness in the quarter. We're still forecasting mid-single-digits positive for the full-year. Some -- the only weakness that we're really experiencing for the full-year would be the military OEM based on this supply chain things I'd mentioned.The Aerospace team has done a fantastic job. There's a couple of factors Nigel it's Tom again. First of all a nice commercial MRO uptake. So Todd mentioned that commercial MRO up 33% for the quarter and order entry on a 312 was over 70%. So you're starting to see that replenishment of commercial aftermarket which is up the 4 elements the highest margin than than we would have. And then within that kind of favorable mix of that within that favorable mix the spare to repair mix was favorable. So at the beginning that was just typical when customers were trying to maintain assets and minimize costs they'll do more repair work. And then once that's exhausted and they have to put back in spares. So we've seen an uptake in spare activity. And then the aerospace team has done a great job. If you go back to the beginning of pandemic we moved very aggressively at the beginning to resize the business for the long cycle. And what's really remarkable here is we're going to put up -- these margins were putting up the guide at 20.9% will be higher than our previous all-time high pre - COVID. And so this business is not even that 80% volume of COVID. And it's putting up margins that are higher than the best we've ever done pre-COVID. This is fantastic job. And to your point Nigel if you were to go compare that aerospace performance against other aerospace peers I think we would do quite well with that.Absolutely Steve as Thomas Williams I can let Lee Chime in if there's anything extra. Our distributors are flying the same challenges when you talk to them they would love to be building inventory. This is what would be strategic use of cash for them as they could but they are having a hard time. All of our suppliers are getting out to where they would like them to be. So there's pretty much running hand about. And so that -- when I think about the longer-term opportunities for us on growth here you've got the pent-up demand that reflects off the towards the bottom. But there will be an inventory replenishment back to normal levels for distribution which will be -- will help us. And if you go out longer than that you've got CapEx reinvestment. Two things there under-investment in I think this whole localization as a giant burner underneath it now because of this lack of product availability is going to drive customers and suppliers to add capacity and to create dual capacities which has infrastructure opportunities for us ESG and then just the capital deployments. So I think there's long-term secular growth trajectory but to get to your more near-term question Yes the distributors are in desperate need of more material and we're doing everything that we can to get it to them.companies that are accretive on margins and cash and growth. So it's not an overnight sensation it's really you go to that one slide that shows the EBITDA trend it's been building on the pace of that improvement on top of some very quick cost actions that we did in the pandemic. And thankfully not a lot of those costs have come back. We've been able to run the business differently in a more digital fashion which is clearly helped us on some of those variable costs.Jeff it's Tom. No not at all. We're -- we're on schedule. We're always kind of anticipated third quarter next calendar year. The reviews we're doing with the government on economic and national security will conclude well before that. And then really the pacing item will be just the anti-trust and FTI filings which are proceeding as planned but you just can't predict every country as the different process and timing. And it's difficult to project that outcome. So that's our best guess but everything is on schedule.Yeah it's Tom again. So it's basically that 2/3 numbers. That's how we came up with it it's 2/3. Our revenue today would be supporting clean tech. I would argue everything we do supports sustainability even if you take say engine and mobile filtration that we've be doing for heavy-duty trucks is helping that fuel run more efficiently and better emissions So even today we just try to be very conservative in that number recognizing that that was still a fossil fuel related technology. But it's going to morph into a 100% of the portfolio because everything is -- if you take construction equipment fossil fuel moves to more electric all you're really doing is changing the power source. You're going from say engine at and a getting engine diesel engine to higher Gen Energen or FuelCell or battery or some combination thereof. And all of our technologies are still needed to facilitate the work functions and the propel functions. And if anything like I had mentioned before our build material gets bigger because there's much more heat and you've got a management of all of our engineering materials technologies. We do have I think a bigger bill of material that we'll have -- with our motion technologies as we add more motor content and more software etc. So we're very excited. It came back to those secular trend for us: Aerospace ESG electrification and digitization. I think you're going to see a different Parker if you look at for the next 5.,0.003181744,0.003561974,0.000243106
138,138,ABNB,Chesky:,Yes maybe why don't we do this day? Why don't I answer a high level of the second question because I just wanted to share a point about our urban business? And then maybe you can go into the details about both inflation impact on consumer behavior and kind of how we're comparing to our peers in urban markets. James the thing I would just say about our business is I think that our business is uniquely resilient in a uniquely adaptable model. And the reason our model is adaptable is because we are not just the US business. We are not just the European business. We are a global business and we are strong in Europe North America Asia Latin America Africa we're global. We're in 220 countries regions one of those global companies in the world. We're not just a vacation rental business. We're vacation rental markets. But our bread and butter is urban cross border was really how we got our start. So we're very much an urban a rural vacation and an off the grid we even have homes totally off the grid. We have homes that are 20 30 bucks a night and 10s of 1000s of dollars a night. So we're really at all price points. We have catered to families and individuals. So we have nearly every type of home at every price point and every type of space and nearly every type of community around the world. And so I think that we've been able to be uniquely resilient. And the other thing I want to say about our urban market business is we're seeing record long term stays. I'm doing this call for example from New York City Airbnb where I have for a month. And we're seeing in New York City for example a huge uptick in long term stays because a lot of people have to come here working remotely for months at a time. So that's just a little bit of how we think about it. Dave I'll hand it over to you and go to a little bit more detail.Yes so why don't I take the first question about higher interest rates or recessions impact on supply and Dave to take the second question. Jed no way to know for sure on your question but I'm pretty sure I've a sense of it. Airbnb we launched on August 11 2008. So you'll remember what the world was like in August 2008. And we really got going January February March of 2009 in the depths of the Great Recession. And the reason that Airbnb initially grew was that people were having trouble paying their rent having trouble keeping their homes and people turn to Airbnb to list their homes. And what we generally see is in recessions people change their behavior. And they change their behavior based on kind of price considerations. And so will generally expect in a recession if that were to happen is that probably more people would turn to hosting. That would be number one. So that we would expect and number two travelers would probably become more budget conscious. And that would probably have a benefit to Airbnb as well. Now the downside of course the recession is often times fewer people travel. But again I think we're a pretty resistant business whether it's economy's good or bad we're pretty adaptable model. So that's what I would expect in the supply side that's the more difficult to the economy is the more people are going to need supplemental income. And a lot a handful of them will turn to hosting. Dave I'll hand it over to you.All right. Well thanks Mark. It's great to hear from you again. First of all yes I'm 40. I hope I got a good 10 years in me and I think I'm a pretty late bloomer so maybe give even more than 10 years. And so what I want to do at that time well one of the things I want to do is experiences. I think that experiences is a massive massive opportunity. When we started Airbnb air homes took off. And I remember saying at the time Mark well we've monetized people's biggest asset already which is their home what do we do next we go to the next largest asset. And it actually turns out your home is not your largest asset from a latency standpoint I think it's your time for most people your time ultimately can generate more revenue for the average person than their property can. And so that's a bit of an insight of where experiences came. It also came from the fact that a lot of people book Airbnb not just to save money but to have a local travel experience. And I think experiences are a great way to do that. And so I was expecting 2020 to be the breakout year for experiences we prepared for that. And of course the opposite happened the pandemic occurred and we put the product on hold. In the last two years when people aren't really comfortable leaving their house they have to mask on it's not really been the right conditions to double down on experiences. But now that the light is at the end of the tunnel of the pandemic we think people's first trips won't be to meet strangers and go on experiences we think the first trips we want to have are to reunite with family unite with friends get a big home together. And so we think that this summer though people will book experiences I think the summer still a little more about homes just because people are getting comfortable getting out of their house. That being said I think this summer you're going to start to see a ramp up of experiences I think next year and beyond itâ€™s going to be a massive opportunity and Iâ€™m incredibly excited about it and one of the reasons I am so excited about it is that our guest actually from a customer satisfaction standpoint like experience more than homes they actually leave a significantly higher five star rating as a percentage of their ratings for experiences at home. The people like home the retention is really good. So we think this is just scratching the surface. And so to answer your question definitively we are going to be ramping up we're going to be getting more aggressive experiences we will be a slower on ramp in this year but by next year we're going to be going full throttle. And I'm really excited about this opportunity. And it's a little hard I don't want to make too many predictions about how big it will become. But my general sense is it's kind of probably bigger than most of us imagined just because I think people are looking for interesting things to do with people. People are lonely they want to meet one another they want to do activities they can only go to so many restaurants they can only watch so many shows on Netflix and many physical communities are being digitized. And so people ultimately want to have real experience in the real world. I think travel is a great way to do that. And the final thing I'd say Mark is the increasingly people aren't just booking homes in Paris you go to Paris you can see the Eiffel Tower you can go to Loire. But if you go to a small town in France what do you do other than go to a restaurant experience is a great way to do something interesting in nearly every community in the world especially ones that don't have the Eiffel Tower. So that's -- those are just some of the reasons why I am incredibly bullish about this product. But it's going to take some time to really wrap up.Yes Dave do you want to take this one?Yes hey Rohan I can just start the cross border is I would say North America Europe Australia Latin America pretty much everywhere but Asia and it's really going in all directions. So people are coming into North America people in North America are leaving. They're absolutely going to Europe there's a lot of travel within Europe. And we're now also seeing Europeans come to the United States and go kind of in other locations as well. So the great thing is the network effect is kind of moving in multiple directions. Whereas say last year it was much more domestic and kind of really limited the corridors are really starting to open. So Dave I'll let you take the rest of the answer.All right. Dave do you want to take it?Sorry. Can I actually can I ask a clarifying I don't quite understand the first question. Can you ask it again?The way that question -- yes can you clarify the first question? About first question consumer demand --The industry. Yes for alternative accommodations and proven incredibly sticky. Despite reopening more host are coming online those sorts of things I guess to what do you owe this kind of stickiness in consumer travel patterns?Oh why is it sticky? Are you -- so sorry I want to make sure I understand. Are you saying why? It like it was obvious why people were booking homes last year because people weren't traveling for business. They weren't going to urban markets. They weren't crossing borders. They were staying nearby. So you're asking why â€“Trying to reopen -- why they're still sticky. Okay got it. Yes. Okay I got it. Thank you. And then let me do that. And then Dave you can take the second question. So I mean I think it's important to just note Lee that like we were growing really fast before the pandemic. And the reason we are growing fast is number one I think a lot of people want to have a local experience they travel number two they want to save money when they travel. Number three Airbnb allows them to travel with groups and increasingly people are traveling in groups. Number four Airbnb allows them to travel and stay in nearly every community in the world hotels on unlimited markets around the world. And number five the longer you're away from home the more you want to be in a home and length of stay is going up. So I think all those reasons explain the stickiness. Maybe said another way there's another way of saying rural demand increased during the pandemic and people are still traveling to rural areas. People are still traveling domestically which was a very popular demand use case during the pandemic people don't have to go back to the office five days a week. So people are still booking weekly stays and monthly stays. So again domestic non-urban in longer stays were three use cases that weren't really our original bread and butter our original bread and butter was urban cross border short term. But these three trends are sustaining they're still sustaining. And the reason why is I think the genie is out of the bottle people have permanent flexibility. And people now realize there's a lot of great places to go beyond the top 100 tourist destinations. That being said what we're seeing is a recovery of cross border in urban it's actually both above 2019 levels. So in short the old ways the bread and butter of Airbnb cross border urban are back in the new use cases or the use cases that were accelerated at pandemic are here to stay. And the combination of those two things is why I think this business is so sticky maybe a more fundamental way of saying it is people love the experience they have. And so when people love them they tend to do more of it. Dave I'll hand over to you.All right. Well thank you all for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud of what we accomplished this quarter. We hit new records with nights and experiences booked and GBV. We had our first positive Q1 adjusted EBITDA and our highest free cash flow ever $1.2 billion of cash flow. But we're just getting started because we are going to be accelerating our pace of innovation. And I'm really excited to announce the biggest change to Airbnb in a decade. It's going to be next Wednesday May 11 at 9 AM Eastern Standard Time you can watch a special event right from our homepage. Until then thank you. I'll see you soon.,0.3068464,0.775558352,0.315357529
139,139,APH,Norwitt:,I did make that mention and we think some portion of our organic growth certainly not the totality but some portion is a credit to our teams long term and very challenging efforts on pricing. I mean the thing about our traditional broadband business as you know is it has a very high material content but it hasn't always had a very rational competitive landscape. And so I think what we're starting to see now is the severity of the inflation has really woken up the other participants in the market that there needs to be some reasonable sharing of that inflation with customers and we've always been at the forefront of that. I've said for many many years that we don't let the sun set on a pricing action from our peers in order to match that and to keep up with these inflationary pressures. And I think we've taken maybe even more of a leadership position over the course of the last year or so. And we're pleased to see some signs of maybe a little bit more discipline in that market that didn't traditionally have as much discipline. And it is a market where the inflation has a disproportionate impact because of the higher material content the raw material content things like plastics and metals and the like. And so we're hopeful it's certainly not a kind of fully told story here but we're encouraged to start to see a little bit more progress in pricing in that market.And I would use the same adjectives as you that it is a sad situation what is happening in Ukraine tragic in many respects. But I would also tell you that we're proud of the role that our company has played both in supporting refugees coming from the Ukraine and some of the neighboring countries where we have operations. Not only supporting them monetarily but also providing jobs to some. I mean this has been a real initiative by our team to support these people who have really had their livelihoods crushed. And at the same time I think we've all witnessed the power of defense and that some of these new technologies that we have talked about for so many years have real importance in people's lives to keep a country safe in the face of what I think many would consider unreasonable aggression. So I wouldn't want to comment on specific conversations that we have in the defense industry. You can imagine that that's not something that we would want to do. But I think we're encouraged for the long term to see that many countries are waking up to the fact that maybe the defense budgets should be calibrated a little bit better to the level of threat that may very well exist in the world in order to keep the peace loving people of the world more secure. And that can translate into overall spending and it can translate long term into an acceleration of adoption of technologies. I've talked for a long time about the kind of difference in the defense industry between the more tactical defense spending and the more strategic defense spending. And I think Jim you've covered us probably as long as anyone and you've heard that theme before. And I think what we're seeing here is no doubt about it a shift of market and relatively rapid shift in the focus of countries especially those countries in NATO towards an emphasis of strategic defense. And whenever you start talking about strategic defense you immediately start to talk about technology. You talk about radar you talk about missile defense. You talk about all of the things that electronics can do to protect people in their homes and in their sovereign nations. And I think Amphenol has played a leading role over the years in being an enabler of those kind of next-generation electronic defense systems. And so to the extent that this tragic and unfortunate conflict does drive an even greater focus among NATO countries. We certainly sit as the leader in the military interconnect market in a position to really help those countries to help the companies that are supporting that initiative in really adopting next-generation technology to protect all of the citizens of these sovereign countries.And relative to your question on M&A Wamsi no question we have a propensity to look for acquisitions across every one of our markets and across all of our 3 now segments as we call them. We're not at all going to kind of direct our resources strategically towards one or another. They all have -- it's an equal opportunity resource for all of them. And to the extent that we find strong acquisitions with the criteria that I alluded to earlier we're very aggressive and happy to make those acquisitions regardless of which segment it's in.I mean it's interesting. When we look across all of our end markets in terms of our book-to-bill we had pretty strong books-to-bill across really all of our end markets with the exception of mobile devices where it's always kind of one-to-one and I think broadband was also relatively flat book-to-bill. But all the other markets had pretty robust books to bill. And I would say maybe automotive was even a little below the average but still a strong more than one book-to-bill. And I don't know that I would draw any conclusions about automotive and the past performance or the trajectory based on those bookings. I think what I would just highlight again is that our performance in automotive has been really consistently outperforming the end market whatever the end market is. Lots of people take lots of different cuts at what is end market performance units or whatever it is. But for sure our growth in this quarter where we achieved 17% growth that was on the heels of last quarter where we grew 18% the quarter before 31%. The quarter before that was even this kind of crazy number of more than 100%. And I just think that it's a reflection of the dynamics that I have talked about earlier and before which is the higher content that we see on next-generation platforms. In particular we've seen a market increase in the adoption of electrification electrified drivetrains and our team has done a fabulous job to position themselves in that area. And we're doing that really across the globe really broadly from a geographical perspective. And then all the other new electronic systems that are coming into cars where we're not necessarily taking share from out of one pocket but we are maybe getting a little more than our fair share of these new things because of our reactivity to the customers and the appropriateness and the breadth of the technology that we can offer from the interconnect products connectors value-add interconnect products sensors and antennas. And so I think our position in automotive while certainly we're not the biggest in the automotive interconnect space far from it but I think our performance has really been differentiated because of our ability to really capture a little bit more than our fair share of these new things.I don't think we put an exact number on the COVID shutdowns and we don't plan to I think we -- it's not like a massive impact. It's also hard to count it. I mean every day it's changing a little bit but there's certainly some impact And I think I mentioned earlier we see it most in the mobile devices but we see it in a few other markets as well like automotive and IT datacom and industrial. In terms of the linearity of bookings our first quarter we saw pretty good strength through the quarter. I mean February is a short month of sort of Chinese New Year but we finished the quarter really strong and bookings in March were really strong indeed. And April we're still three days away from the end so I couldn't even give you a number if I wanted to but we'll see how it goes here in April. I mean would I expect a 1.17:1 book-to-bill here in the second quarter? I don't think I would expect that. I didn't expect it coming into the first quarter and we had very strong bookings. But I don't expect that here in the second quarter but we'll see. I think customers still have quite a propensity to give us business new and existing and that's translating into very robust orders for quite a number of quarters here.Look it's hard to sort of pinpoint it because at the end of the day why does the customer give us an order in any given moment? I mean there's an enormous number of factors that go into that all along the spectrum from the technology that we offer the reliability of our delivery to that customer our quality our support the breadth of our relationship obviously the price thatâ€™s something that no customer wants to ever forget about. And so as you build over a long term a sustainable advantage with customers it's all about continuing to just add to each of those factors further reason for customers to place an order to you and not to your competitor. And I think over the last two years -- look over a long time that's always our focus. How do we have a little bit better product? How do we have a little bit better quality? How do we have a little bit better credibility of delivery? How do we have a more competitive cost by going to low-cost countries and the like? But what has changed over these two years is there's a new factor that customers are considering and that is risk. And I will tell you that over many years I've been -- now I'm in my 24th year in this company and my 14th year as CEO I think customers underaccounted for risk in many cases because it was just easy to say well here's the price and the quality is good and it's the right product. And we don't really need to think about all these kind of black swan events that may or may not happen. And by the way that was true through earthquakes and tsunamis that was true through volcanos in Iceland and floods in Thailand and all these things. But something about the last two years has caused them really to wake up to think about the real risk of their supply chain. And when they do that and they look at the landscape of competitors they look at a small company and they see risk. They look at a centralized company and they see risk. But when they look at Amphenol and they look at our decentralized very fragmented very global we have more than what something like 250 factories around the world which is a lot more than most companies of our size. There they see not risk but actually opportunity. And I think that that change has been just another factor that didn't exist in the past. And where does it manifest? I mean I think it does manifest to some degree in our outperformance and then the continuation of our outperformance. As it relates to M&A I think there is actually also an advantage because if you're a small company and you've been through this kind of rubicon of challenges that we've all faced over these couple of years being part of a bigger company that gives you more options of where you can make stuff and where you can source stuff and where you can sell stuff so that starts to be a pretty compelling thing to think about if you really truly care about the company that you as an entrepreneur have built. And so I think that can also have an advantage. I think there's advantages that sort of go throughout the business. And it's again why we're so religious about our adherence to the culture of Amphenol that unique entrepreneurial culture which has served us in good times and bad. And I think the value of it has been more enhanced over these last couple of years than really ever before.No doubt about it. Our team working and industrial market has just been consistently outstanding in their performance. I mean since the kind of acute phase of COVID in Q1 of 2020 at least in Asia we've posted consistently strong double-digit year-over-year growth every quarter since then. So we just did our eighth straight quarter in industrial of strong double-digit growth and it's really a testament to their efforts. And as you pointed out it's a very broad market. It's everything from advanced medical equipment to next-generation agricultural equipment to high-speed rail to semiconductor manufacturing equipment to heavy equipment to electrification of heavy vehicles and battery technology battery storage where we see just a lot of opportunities to enable a real myriad of customers who are developing next-generation energy storage systems and they want our sensors they want our connectors. They want everything. I mean these applications are really all over the place. And they all go on somewhat different cycles I should say. But at the end of the day they have one thing in common which is it is the adoption of electronics into harsh environments into areas where those electronics otherwise should not really be able to operate. And that is a legacy that we have of many many decades of building up the capability of packaging interconnect and sensors for harsh environments which now means putting highly computerized autonomous driving systems on tractors and now means putting next-generation sensor technologies and alternative energy devices and monitoring of wind mills and things like this. I mean I could go on and on and on. And amidst the uncertain global macro you have the certainty of the continued onward and upward march of the adoption of electronics. So I'm not going to say that we're going to grow every quarter here in perpetuity by these outstanding amounts. No I mean I wouldn't expect that we're going to grow by 31% every quarter going forward. But I do believe that the opportunity to outperform here remains very strong and that the breadth of our industrial product technologies is really second to none and I think that positions us well for the future.I mean we're not guiding necessarily to growth by segment. I think we gave a lot of details by each of our end markets. But as you saw this quarter I mean the growth was pretty balanced across those segments. Now we had really broad growth across the company. So I wouldn't necessarily say that what we would expect by each segment going into here in the second quarter.I mean I don't know that there's a significant impact Joe from kind of the hot potato of people crossing semiconductors back and forth and deciding where they should put their -- which vehicles they should put them in and thereby which they should sell and prioritize. I mean look if our customers are building higher content cars is that a good thing? Yes I guess that would certainly be a good thing. But that should be a good thing for everybody in the market. And I think would that drive specifically our outperformance? I don't know that that would necessarily be the case. I think really what we see and I'll just reiterate it again is we see just an acceleration of the adoption of next-generation systems across all vehicles and that includes the electrified drivetrains that we mentioned but not exclusively that. It's next-generation infotainment next-generation communication it's next-generation comfort passenger comfort it's next-generation connectivity in the cars it's everything from sensors that keep the HVAC systems running better and being safer for the people inside. I mean you think about like going through a respiratory-borne illness pandemic and all of a sudden car companies want to have better HVAC filtration and sensing inside their cars. And that's a great new application that may not have existed kind of in the past. And so I think that's the bigger driver here than just that some car companies are making more tactical decisions about which models to produce based on constrained availability of certain components. Well thank you very much to everybody. I think that's our last question. And I do want to take this opportunity once again to thank you all for spending a few of your precious time -- a few of your precious minutes with us today and wish you all the best and we look forward to seeing everybody again either over the course of this quarter or at the latest 90 days from now. Thanks so much everybody.,0.002998069,0.004152298,0.000476602
140,140,SRE,Martin:,The only point that I would clarify for you Steve too is that these projects tend to have something in the neighborhood of a 48-month to 50-month window for construction so once you take FID. And secondly Justin conveyed that accurately the debottlenecking because it will be a series of ongoing projects which are conducted concurrent with construction you'd expect to see the benefit of that 1 million-tonne per annum that we're targeting start to show up across multiple periods between 2024 2025 and 2026.Yes sure. I would say taking you back Steve to the Q4 call you'll recall that we had completed about $500 million of share repurchases in December of 2021 and in January of 2022. And as part of that we committed to a long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. I cited earlier on the call that over the last 5 years we've grown at roughly 11% in terms of our EPS. So I'm quite comfortable reaffirming our expectation that we are quite comfortable growing this business long term between 6% and 8%. But we indicated on the Q4 call that we would complete $1 billion share repurchase before the end of 2023. And I would just say at this point nothing has changed as it relates to that forecast. We've simply brought forward $250 million of that targeted amount. The key takeaway from my perspective and from Trevor's perspective is we're excited to be executing our $36 billion capital program. And we view our dividend program Steve together with these periodic share repurchases is a great way to return value to our shareholders along the way.No I think there's a very clear message. And you recall back when our stock was trading at a different price in Q2 Q3 Q4 of last year we've been fairly consistent about our view of our ability to grow this business at a rate faster than our peers. And in combination we think we have a very unique growth and income story. We thought that we were undervalued in Q4 and that's one of the reasons we put some dollars to work in the share repurchase program. And if you look at where we were trading relative to the peer group in Q4 of last year we're just as deeply discounted at this moment in time to our peer group as we were back in Q4. So there's a strong view on this management team that this stock should trade consistent with the peer group or better. And that's one of the reasons we're very comfortable going in the marketplace to continue our share repurchase program.Yes. Thank you for the question and we don't mind providing additional color. I think that -- I think I just want to convey that we've been in this business for close to 2 decades and we understand what it takes to get the project done. I'm very pleased that we got ECA Phase 1 moving forward in Q4 of 2020. We've made a lot of progress recently on all of our projects. But the ones I would focus on is number one it's really really important to this management team and our Board of Directors that we execute our existing capital campaign and our largest project today is underway at ECA Phase 1. So our top priority is to execute on the existing FID that we took on that project. Secondly we spent a lot of airtime in the last 3 or 4 earnings calls talking about Cameron expansion. It truly has a cost advantage in the marketplace. So the ability to basically add one train and effectively with debottlenecking 7 million tonnes per annum is a remarkable opportunity against the backdrop of the world being short LNG particularly at this moment in time in Europe. And then beyond that we are clearly looking at all the different opportunities around Vista Pacifico and Port Arthur. But I think the thing I always want to convey is we are very very disciplined. And I gave a poor golf analogy earlier but from our standpoint it's not always a race. We think that there's a lot of value and there's a lot of customers in the marketplace that want to work with a company that has a strong balance sheet and a strong record -- a track record and is focused on doing things the right way. So we think we have a unique position in the marketplace. We don't think about it from a speed perspective but we think about it from executing with deliberation and the right values to make sure that we can deliver the best risk-adjusted cash flows to our investors. So right now the focus is making sure we execute on our existing construction program and that we run headlong toward Cameron expansion with a great group of partners. And as Justin indicated earlier we expect to have that project fully contracted or substantially so by the end of Q2.Sure. I think I made a comment earlier that we feel very good about our 3 growth platforms. And I'll tell you one of the observations that we've had in our strategy discussions with our Board of Directors was very early in the first half of the pandemic of 2020 we realized the value in this sector of scale right? So as you think about the Clean Energy transition you think about the GRC programs that are going forward in our company here in California and Texas there's no question that putting IEnova together with LNG and have -- circling some EBITDA figure of around $2 billion was the right move with an investment-grade balance sheet. So I think one of the things we're benefiting from right now is we're in the best markets that are experiencing tremendous growth and we've been able to put together 3 businesses at scale. So when we came out with our 6% to 8% long-term growth rate we have a very bullish view of what we can accomplish and it's really around the market position and scale that we have across all 3 of these areas. And right now as you think about inorganic opportunities I think we can effectively take those off the table. We've got a $36 billion capital program and our job is to execute that with discipline and I think we're going to be in a position to outperform.Yes I'll make just a quick comment and I'll pass it to Justin. Maybe Justin you can update them on how the type of conversations you're seeing in terms of contract tender. But I just returned to one of the things I said in my earlier remarks which is there's no question that everyone now can see what we've been forecasting which is this net short position in Europe. And the magnitude of what is required to back out 8 billion cubic feet per day of gas is a significant number of new capacity that will exceed even what the U.S. LNG community can provide. But Asia is a larger opportunity. So I think if you look at the opportunity in both markets there's going to be a real demand near term and long term for more LNG facilities. And that impacts the pricing environment and the opportunity to have longer tenured contracts. But Justin maybe you can provide a little bit of color on the conversations you're having.Yes that's correct.I would say it's one of our lowest priorities.Yes great question. I will tell you that we've got a lot of folks inside of our company that are focused on both opportunities around green molecules and green KWs. But I think what we view is there's going to be a requirement that we transition in an orderly way toward increasing clean resources. And we're very very bullish on electrification. I hope we get the chance for Allen Nye to update you on some of the really large-scale electrifications taking place in the Texas marketplace. But I would also tell you there are some hard to decarbonize areas in American society largely heavy industry heavy transportation some of the maritime and aviation uses of energy. So in California there's growing recognition by the regulator and across all market participants that there's going to be a strong trend toward electrification. But there's really a convergence between the need for green molecules to power some of that electrification and to help decarbonize. So I think the commission deserves a tremendous amount of credit for taking a forward-looking view on renewable natural gas as an example. You may recall that over 3 years ago we set a target for 2030 of 20% of our core customers being served by RNG. And that was well before this ever came on the radar screen for our regulator. And now that they've adopted targets that progress over time up to closer to 12% we feel like we're in a great position. I think we came out at around 4% penetration in our core customers at the end of 2021. And we continue to be optimistic about executing against some of the expectations of our regulators. So we firmly believe there's a role both for cleaner molecules and for cleaner electrification and we expect to see both of those work in tandem going forward.It sure is a self-funding model. And I think it goes back to a couple of comments I've stitched together this morning which was we think one of the great lessons from the COVID economic environment was the importance of scale. And scale will be even more important when we think about what we need to accomplish across all 3 platforms and putting together those 2 businesses with an IG balance sheet. Our clear intention was to make sure it's a self-funded platform and Faisel gave some examples of how we expect to do that using project-level equity internally generated cash flows and project finance.I think it's a positive. Let me explain why. Roughly 80% of our earnings mix comes from what we think are some of the best utility platforms in the United States right? So our ability to basically grow rate base off of a $42 billion number at the end of last year at 9% going forward in our 5-year plan is a remarkable opportunity. But our ability to basically exceed expectations and grow this business faster than we forecasted really turns to our ability to how we grow Sempra Infrastructure right? So we're at a moment in time where across all 3 platforms inside Justin's business that's the LNG and Net Zero solutions business Clean Power and our energy network business. That has a chance to provide some really unique additive growth to our portfolio. So we talked a lot about our growth in the past. We've got a very strong portfolio of bond-like returns from our California platform and our Texas platform but our opportunity to exceed people's expectations is going to rely a lot on how they execute across their portfolio in Sempra Infrastructure.You may remember 15 or 20 years ago a lot of M&A in our sector was limited to businesses that were actually contiguous. That's no longer a requirement. But one of the things we think about from our strategy is how do we extract synergies and efficiencies across all 3 platforms. And at Sempra the value of the parent company as we focus on people process and technology to help drive the results across all 3 platforms and having a contiguous platform is really helpful. And I'll tell you the way I view it is a lot of people broadly diversify their businesses. They're in different markets in different jurisdictions but they fail to have the discipline to make sure they're extracting the benefits of diversification. In our case we think the best way to manage risk is to go deeper in the markets that are most important. So when you think about California as the fifth largest economy in the world Texas has moved from #10 to #9 and Mexico is currently #15 and forecasted by 2040 to be #7 in the world what we want to do is we want to have great regulatory relationships in those marketplaces. We want to understand all the market fundamentals and we want to make sure that we're putting together a capital allocation strategy that allows us to extract the best risk-adjusted opportunities in those markets. So one of the things I've talked about before is we've grown this business over the last 2 decades at a 7% EPS CAGR in an industry that has grown over the same period of time at 3%. And that's not just because we're better managers. It's because we're in the right market. So this focus on being deep and committed to extracting efficiencies in each of our core markets -- and contiguity is a part of that -- is part of our winning strategy we believe.Thank you. We've -- I would just say that we're really excited about both ECA Phase 1 which is under construction and Vista Pacifico. They both really leveraged the same common resource of Permian gas and we have a straight shot through 2 different pipeline systems to support Vista Pacifico. I had the opportunity to have dinner with the President of Mexico and John Kerry a couple of weeks ago in Mexico City. And the topic of that conversation Ryan was how we can move Vista Pacifico along at a faster pace. In Mexico they understand the value of being able to export some of their natural resources particularly high sulfur oil but they also want to make sure that they raise their marquee status as an exporter of LNG. So I'm pleased with the type of support we have across the government inside of Mexico to support that project going forward. But Justin maybe you can talk about how you're thinking about the capacity at Vista Pacifico.And are you focused more on the LNG side or you're talking about across the enterprise Ryan?Sure. Faisel please take that.Right. You recall just by way of analogy at Cameron one of the things we did in concert with our partners was look at opportunities for us to lower our overall greenhouse gas footprint at Cameron and that caused us to shift our filings to move to an electric drive for Cameron Phase 2. We're looking at things very similarly at Port Arthur. I think one of the unique advantages Port Arthur has is number one at scale and the degree that it's fully permitted across almost every aspect of the development currently. So I think the expectation would be that electric will probably be part of Phase 2 at Port Arthur LNG. And given the level of interest we have in Phase 1 we would proceed as we've currently filed.We currently haven't put out an expectation for FID at Port Arthur. I would say that we are having conversations with more than 20 different counterparties related to that project and the interest is very high. But again I think I've said it 2 or 3 times on this call we're really committed internally to take a measured approach and be very disciplined. And if we can get that project in a box with really really solid risk-adjusted cash flows it's the type of project that could move forward in our time line.Sure. I think this might be an opportunity if you allow me I think we can comment on the rate case and maybe give a little bit of visibility into the growth we're seeing there. I know Allen had a remarkably positive press release they put out that tracked a lot of that. Let me just start by saying before I pass it to Allen Trevor and I were in Dallas last week for the Oncor Board meeting. We could not have been more pleased with the comprehensive nature of the growth they're seeing on their system. As you know in the market they'd say the comment about don't fight the tape. There is a strong tape in Texas towards further growth. They raised their capital program from 2022 from $2.8 billion to $3 billion. And Allen maybe perhaps we could do 2 things. Maybe you could walk folks through some of the growth you're seeing on the system because I think your examples would be helpful to people and then get right to Julien's question about how we think about settlement which has been the tradition at Oncor as you look at regulatory filings like this.Thank you Allen.Michael we usually have a 7-limit question for LNG on our call but we're going to take your eighth question just because of our long-standing relationship okay?I'm joking with you. But we've done a lot on Cameron. This isn't something we started in the last 12 months. We've got a lot of definitive work that's been done. In fact Cameron has benefited from a lot of the work that was done at Port Arthur over the last several years. So we're in great shape in terms of our understanding of the cost structure of that business. I think what you're seeing us do is make sure there's a competitive process. We want to make sure that we've got a clear understanding of the schedule all the key milestones that we need to have in place so that we can execute well. I think we have a shot to execute Cameron Phase 2 exceedingly better than how we executed Cameron Phase 1. And this additional detailed work is part of our desire to have a really clean execution plan. So the way I would read into it is I made this comment earlier our confidence level in the detail of this project and the commercial viability of the project has gone up dramatically in the last 4 or 5 months. And this additional work I think only adds more value to the schedule and more importantly more value to the project.Michael I would also add to that that we go back and think about the last time Allen settled a rate case which was in November of 2017. At that time they had a forward 5-year capital program of $7.5 billion. And in the last 4 years it's doubled to $15 billion. And based upon what Trevor and I saw at last week's Board meeting and some of the feedback that Allen has given us this has all been done around the idea of meeting new load growth. But today that load growth is continuing and we're now looking at the prospect of adding in what Allen described earlier which is more spending around resiliency and obsolescence to make sure that we can integrate all these different loads. So my basic thesis here Michael is being in the right markets really good markets with good regulatory jurisdictions and solid growth is a great way to outperform your peers and Oncor is a great example. And I'll tell you Allen and his team are running a great program. And I think as we get toward October not only would they be prosecuting their rate case and hoping that that will be settled I think we're going to be looking at increased capital spending. That's one of the reasons they've been running their equity layer at around 45% instead of 42.5% headed into this rate case.Look Paul it's a great question. And obviously there's been a lot of moving forces going across the supply and demand marketplace both for oil and natural gas and even in electricity in some markets. Markets like Europe have a lot of gas on the margin -- markets for electricity. But I would say that you've got about a 6.5 to 7.5 Bcf per day marketplace that we export to Mexico. And you've also got this 11 or 12 Bcf marketplace as we export LNG around the world. So that's about 20 Bcf per day. And what's interesting is on a relative basis Henry Hub has been -- has not had a lot of price volatility relative to the markers you usually see for natural gas in Europe at TTF or JKM. So long term remember there hasn't been a lot of investment over the last 5 years from the oil and gas sector in new sources of delivery. And I think you're going to continue to see market forces continue to come back in and raise the rates of production as necessary to meet demand. So I can't give you a definitive forecast. It's something that we follow closely. But we're very confident about the level of natural gas resources in the United States and the United States being best positioned to meet the growing demand for both Asia and for Europe. There is a DOE study that I would refer you to. In the DOE analysis they talk about the United States' ability to supply these different markets over the next 20 years and that might be a good resource for you to reference.I think that's fair and I would also -- I think that's fair. And I'd also remind folks that because we're T&D focused as we look at launching these various LNG projects you remember Cameron was a tolling project. ECA Phase 1 is a project where we don't take any commodity risk because you're buying at an index and you're selling at an index. So in terms of shielding our projects the way you do that is you make sure you got long-term contracts with good credit counterparties and you make sure you're not taking commodity risk. But in terms of the larger macroeconomic picture I would refer you to that DOE study which tends to indicate the conclusion you just described.Look I just want to stop and thank everyone for joining today's call. We look forward to seeing you all at the upcoming AGA Conference in Florida later this month. Feel free per custom to reach out to our IR team with any additional questions and this concludes today's call.,0.118882257,0.974636316,0.289148752
141,141,MAR,Capuano:,I think you said the second part of your question was really around big multinationals and attitudinally how they are thinking about travel going forward. I'll speak both anecdotally and then statistically whether it's meeting with big multinationals here domestically. I was in Europe last week and met with about 30 travel managers for multinationals across Europe. There's a bit of a tug of war right now I think between managing travel costs and being mindful of carbon footprint and that's being pulled by the absolute desire to collaborate with colleagues meet with customers immerse new employees into corporate cultures. And the statistics particularly that improvement to down 10% to 15% in business transient which suggests that that appetite for the benefits of in-person interaction or are starting to win that tug of war a bit.Yes nothing particularly -- particular in terms of the calendar not yet. We didn't see any particular impact from the timing of Easter. I think our view is generally it's just continued pace of demand recovery acceleration.Good morning.Thank you David.And then I think given that pattern David you also see it manifest itself a little bit in terms of rate. ADR on the weekends was about 4% higher than it was on weekdays in the quarter.Of course.Good morning.Yes yes and yes is the short answer. I think Chad the even pre-pandemic whether it be because of what we were hearing from our customers what we thought would act as an accelerant to the appeal of the Bonvoy platform we have been very focused on continuing to accelerate the growth of our resort portfolio. Similarly we saw both from a development perspective and a guest perspective tremendous appetite for all inclusive experiences in certain markets and whole home rentals for certain trip types. I think you will continue to see us look at organic growth in all of those areas. And as has always been the case continue to look at portfolio deals like what we did with Sunwing last year in the all inclusive space.My pleasure.Thank you Robin.Great I'll take the first one Robin. So as we talked about 2022 we talked about the first quarter being down about 30. The remaining three quarters being down high single digits which give us confidence that we will end up down 15-ish for 2022 although that could improve meaningfully given the short-term booking window that we've seen. As we look into 2023 looking at what's on the books today we're down about 15% relative to 2019. But take my comment about booking window we think there is massive opportunity to close that gap between now and the beginning of 2023.When we talked to you last quarter Robin about group 2023 ADR was pacing up about 4%. As we sit here today we're up about 6.5%.Thanks Robin.So I'll try to answer that qualitatively and Leeny may provide a little color in terms of margins. I would say we are making good progress trying to strike that right balance. We will be landing on our housekeeping solution and announcing that probably towards the end of the second quarter. I think in the markets where demand has recovered most quickly I think we're doing a particularly strong job of striking that right balance. In some of the urban markets where demand has been a bit more slow to recover I think we are on the right path but we still have some work to do in front of us.Sure. So I think we talked last quarter the growth of the platform itself in terms of listings has been pretty remarkable. Pre-pandemic we had 2000 to 3000 listings. We find ourselves today with about 57 000 listings at the end of the first quarter still tiny relative to some of the peers in that space. But again I think distinguished a bit because the composition of our portfolio is 100% multi-bedroom full homes. These are not spare rooms or couches or anything else. These are full multi-bedroom homes. As you would expect with that sort of exponential growth in the sheer volume of listings we've seen a very meaningful uptick in the revenue coming through that platform.Thank you operator. First let me thank you all for your heartfelt condolences. I know how special Laura was to you both as a friend and a colleague so thank you for those kind words. Thanks for your interest and participation today and we look forward to seeing you on the road in the coming weeks and months. Have a great day thanks.,0.003268152,0.003846467,0.000578314
142,142,KMB,Hsu:,Good morning Wendy.Yeah. Overall I'd say Wendy private label is not core to our overall growth strategy. And so it's a relatively small part of our business. And we do it selectively as you mentioned whether for a strategic account or a strategic proposition. But again our capacity is expensive to build and so we want to focus that in general on the brands unless there is a very good strategic rationale for. I will say private label did grow a bit more in the quarter and that's a change from prior quarters. And I think it was up or even in about six of our eight categories that we track and that's a change from the recent quarters. And while we're paying attention to that we're really focused on improving and making sure that we have the right value proposition on our products. And that's why even at the same time Wendy that we are making -- taking price increases we are also working hard to improve the product quality and the features and benefits of our brands as well.I would say -- I was commenting mostly on North America. I think in North America the eight categories we track was even or up in about six of them so.Yes. It's -- I don't think it's a distribution channel thing. And I don't think -- it's definitely not promotion because again we're trying to be disciplined about pricing. Here's the thing and I will say Wendy it's really what Alison talked about at CAGNY which is there is a lot of opportunity in a lot of our markets to premiumnze our category. And I know that's a little bit different because given the conditions right now with pricing and inflation what's happening to the consumer. But over the long term as I mentioned earlier the China -- the value per baby sold is less than half of what it is in the US or other developed markets. And so there still remains a significant opportunity for us to premiumize our categories. And so mix for us has been an important driver. We've doubled our super premium mix just over the past 12 months and so that's part of it. And then the other part of it is share. And what we're really proud that we took share leadership in China in the diaper category I'd say almost two years ago and we continue to expand that. And so we're really proud of the work of our team and we're excited about that. And recognize there are some trends that are not favorable. I mean as you're well aware births are down but we still think there's an opportunity on value.Thanks Wendy.Hey Lauren.Yes. Thank you Lauren. Yes I think that's right. I mean again elevate the categories â€“ I think we have an opportunity to elevate all of our categories and I think that will apply. I think it's -- we -- our teams have been busy working that across the globe on tissue. I think some of that's been drowned out because â€“ especially like in North America the high volatility over the last couple of years related to COVID. For reference I think that category was up 28% in 2020 and then down 20% last year. And so there's been a lot of volatility. That said I'd say we still believe there's a lot of opportunity to elevate the category through better Kleen let's say on the tissue side. I think we have had some momentum on Kleenex and broadening out the usage. And so that's something we remain excited about and we're working hard on. I just think there's been a little more volatility in the tissue categories in North America because I would say the extreme volatility in demand and then in other markets like Latin America and in Western Europe the pricing dynamic has been I would say a little more pressurized.Okay. Excellent.,0.003580242,0.003633142,5.29E-05
143,143,MSI,Brown:,Ben I was just going to say the last part that you said. I think it is more PCR related. I think the way we do that is I think Molloy and John Zidar during this time work really closely with the channel partners particularly in North America on prioritization on active conversations on transparency on what they really need versus what they may think they want to try to eliminate any kind of artificial forecasting. So I think it's a reflection of the relationships we have with the channel partners. And I have to tip my hat to John Zidar who runs that organization under Molloy. I think the way you sort through that is the efficacy and the authenticity of the conversations with the partners during these tough times. And I think Molloy and his team are doing that.Thanks Ben.The only thing I'd add on the high tier and APX. APX NEXT is the complexity of those products and the joint engineering we do and the supply lines we have for semiconductors are unique to those products and we're doing a good job in getting the security of that supply lines. So there are some commonalities but also some uniqueness in our key suppliers and public safety LMR are doing a good job of getting us what we need.Thank you. Fahad.Louie how you doing?Okay. Louie I'll start and Mahesh may want to color in some lines. I think first of all as it relates to fixed video security and access control we've taken a premise and a look at the market to say we want to make sure we meet our customers' for where they are. So it started with Avigilon which is an on-prem end-to-end solution. We've invested in Avigilon cloud services but they had a legacy Access Control business as well. Actually that business was actually the highest growth within the Avigilon portfolio one point in time but we really saw a move to cloud and mobility particularly as people want -- they want smartphones capability to access a building instead of an old keycard. And well I would also tell you that Openpath is seen -- it's been -- it outkicked it business case due to the fact that there is a shortage on card readers right now like a lot of things in the heart. So that's really accelerated the growth into the cloud for Openpath. So I think you will hear a lot of good things. The other piece with Openpath as I said is its cloud. native which is different to the most. So we think we've got a pretty good strategy as it relates to both in terms of a buyer wants to cloud solution or Openpath. I mean now the cloud solution are an on-prem solution. Mahesh anything you want to add to that.Thanks Louis.In terms of state and local budget cycles. I'll remind everyone we have thousands of customers in North America. A common changeover in year is around July 1. So they will look at available funds and as well as stimulus and set their priorities. So we'll see what those budgets look like but all indications are with the backstop of funding that will continue.Yeah. I just want to close -- Thank you for that opportunity. I want to close by thanking all of the Motorola Solutions people around the world for their commitment perseverance in what was a strong Q1. Despite the fluid and dynamic environment demand it just remains exceptionally strong. The customer funding environment remains robust. We continue to make investments in software and video. And as Jason and others outlined in this call we continue to take action to offset higher costs. I would just say this macroeconomic turbulence and uncertainty presents opportunity and we will continue to deploy capital against the backdrop of those opportunities that present themselves. Thank you for joining us. We look forward to talking to you again in a few months. And again to all the Motorola people thank you thank you thank you. Much appreciated.,0.002295822,0.002395391,9.96E-05
144,144,USB,Dolan,: Yes. I think that again we would expect that mortgage -- excuse me that fee income will be relatively stable on a year-over-year basis. So when you end up looking at what's going to be the driver it will be net interest income. And from here on out I think it's going to be kind of a balance between loan growth and interest rates because I -- if I had to kind of give you a mix and I don't necessarily have that with me but it's probably 60% 65% rates and 30% 35% on the loan portfolio growth side of the equation.: Yes. The other thing I would just say is that we'll start to see some seasonal benefit associated with the credit card portfolio as we get into the second and third quarter.: Yes. I mean we're very excited about the payments business. I think there's a number of dynamics that are taking place. I think there's still cyclical recovery that's going to continue on for some period of time and you're going to see that in the airline and the travel and entertainment and those sorts of areas I think that's all good. Mike we've talked a lot about investments that we've been making in our payments businesses. And over the course of the last few years as an example within the merchant acquiring 3 years ago or so our tech-led sort of revenue represented about 15% of our overall merchant acquiring revenue. Today it represents 30% and we would expect that to continue to accelerate because of investments that we're making. We talked about the fact that in a normal environment as the cyclical recovery kind of starts to wane that we would expect our merchant acquiring and our CPS business to grow at high single digits. That's 2 or 3x what we were seeing let's say 4 years ago when we started our investment. So we feel really good about where we're at from a payments perspective at this particular point. Andy what would you add?: Yes. Again I think if you end up looking at the components merchant and CPS on an ongoing basis high single digits I think credit card will be probably at a lower level than that but it will be consistent with the way the rest of the industry is growing.: Again for merchant and CPS we think post '22 high single digits. And we believe that credit card will perform kind of consistent with the rest of the industry. The comps as you say this year will be impacted by the prepaid card revenue because that is coming down but then that starts to normalize as you get into 2023.: Yes we don't expect a lot of that. The large contracts that got renegotiated were more on the CPS side of the equation about 2 years ago and that's kind of fully in the run rate at this particular point in time. As you know that those contracts are usually 10 12 years in length. So we don't see anything on the horizon there.: We're always looking at opportunities to serve the customers in areas they need. The other -- another sort of related is the whole buy now pay later component that we talked about. I mentioned some examples in my prepared remarks but as you think about home equity improvements a new way of financing that is through a buy now pay later or financing a point of sale. So that's something we're also focused on.: Yes. Fair question. And I think there's a lot more conversation around that in terms of whether or not there will be recessionary sort of pressures 12 to 18 months out. I would start by just saying when we end up looking at the economic outlook right now and kind of what we're seeing we continue to see a pretty robust environment. That said Gerard I think it's a fair question because credit issues that we -- decisions we made today and a year ago are what's going to affect us. And we never really changed our underwriting approach. We've always been very focused on as an example in the consumer side we focus on prime and super prime customers in our card business in our auto business et cetera. I think the mortgage just the underwriting associated with mortgages is different today than it was 10 15 years ago which will help. But then on the C&I side of the equation or the corporate side of the equation we do very little leverage lending sort of activities and areas that have been kind of structurally impacted like retail et cetera retail malls et cetera. We've kind of made a lot of changes to our portfolio over the last several years. So I actually think that we'll perform quite well in the event that we were to see recessionary pressures develop.: Within for example the investment portfolio?: Yes. I mean I think that -- I think it's worthwhile just kind of trying to understand the mix of the types of investment securities that people are putting into their particular portfolio. When you get into stress in the economy et cetera certain types of investments may not perform as well in terms of our own portfolio highly concentrated in treasury and government-backed mortgage-backed securities. So we don't see a lot of credit risk in our particular portfolio but it is something I think -- from an industry standpoint it's worthwhile watching.: Yes. It's all related to the timing.: Yes. I mean I think that the bulk of that savings we certainly start to realize some of it later this year but the bulk of it does get realized in 2023. And certainly when we get close to the -- into the fourth quarter and first quarter of '24 the vast majority of it will realized. So I think the timing is very consistent with what we talked about just affected by the timing of the deal.: Yes. With our Corporate Trust business we always see a ramp-up in that type of deposit near the end of the year as deals try to get closed and almost like clockwork around the 10th of January and through February we see a runoff. So it's all really seasonal from our standpoint.: Yes. No it's a good question. And as we kind of go through the modeling then we look at the information on kind of how we think it's going to end up affecting not only us but I think the industry so you're going to see that deposit growth is going to slow. But I do -- our expectation is that certainly that deposit levels overall will grow slowly. And that will be more in line with just the overall growth of the economy. So our expectation is that deposits continue to grow but at a lower rate.,0.002698064,0.002791107,0.00012428
145,145,AZO,Rhodes:,Hey you too Simeon. Thank you.Yes itâ€™s a fantastic question. Michael I wish I could tell you with certainty it was built by x y and z. Let me just share some of our thoughts. But our thoughts are evolving. And we don't have clear insights into the strength of it which we're [Indiscernible] to have but we can't explain every element of it. Clearly an element right now is increased inflation. So our traffic count is positive slightly positive in the retail business. Normally because of changes in technology and the improvement of quality of parts we've typically had three three and a half percent deceleration in in transaction count. So despite the enormous customer count growth we had last year we're still growing customers and growing them much faster than we have let's say on average over the last 10 years. But we also have an inflation benefit. Letâ€™s call it 4% or so on top of that. So that is a significant element. When we believe what we believe was the biggest thing that happened to us in the pandemic was we had a lot of what I call our financially fragile customers. Those lower socio economic customers that had two things that they don't typically have. They had time because many of them were furloughed and they had money because they were living off of stimulus and significant enhanced unemployment. We anticipated as those two things ended in March 15 of 21 and early September 21 on enhanced unemployment that we would see it slow down. I think there are some other dynamics that are happening. You mentioned new and used car sales. One of the things that we believe has happened in the recessions over the years as people change their perspective on how long they're going to keep their car. And so they focus on how they maintain it right versus thinking they're going to get a new car in six months so don't worry about it. I think this environment of new car shortages and use car prices being up I think the last time I saw it something like 38% I think people in particular are more challenged economically customers are thinking I'm going to have this car for a long time. I better take care of it. And I think that also all levels of consumer appear to still be very very healthy financially versus historical norms. And as we've seen for years any period where there's a tax refund or something we see a big spike in our business stimulus we saw big spikes in our business. So I think the fact that they still have more discretionary income than normal bodes well for our business it's showing up in our results and likely stays with us for some period of time. How long your guess is as good as mine.Mine hasnâ€™t been very good either.Yes three very complex questions. I think the answers are yes yes and yes. Let me start and then I'll let Jamere talk about it as well. Yes we've had a long term algorithm that says you know how do we grow store count that 2% to 3%? How do we grow EBIT growth in the 3% to 5% in normal times and maybe faster in these recessionary environments? How do we leverage our consistent and predictable free cash flow to share to do share repurchases that push us in and around double digit EPS growth for a sustained period of time? You remember Michael we had I think 41 consecutive quarters of double digit EPS growth. So that's still long term generally the model that we believe. However we've had the most incredible six straight quarters we've ever seen. There could be a deceleration to get us to whatever the new normal is I would have thought we would have experienced that. By now I feel better about our sustainability of holding on to these significant sales growths over a longer period of time at different levels than I would have thought six and 12 months ago. But once so we may have a slowdown at some point. But I don't believe once we get to whatever the new normal is that the algorithm changes any. You asked would we be willing to grow the commercial business at a faster rate at the expense of gross and operating margin percentages? And I would say an emphatic yes. We are focused on how we grow gross profit dollars and operating profit dollars at an accelerated rate while we make sure we get great returns and I think any organization's running a roughly a 40% ROIC we've proven that we know how to how to leverage our capital structure. Jamere anything that you would say differently or do you want to address his last point?Let me jump in on that too Zach. I think when you look at what's happened over the last three or four years to margins you need to make sure that we don't lose sight of what happened to our DIY business over the last two years. Our same store sales and DIY are up 20% on a two year basis. We are getting a ton of leverage because of that outside sales group our hope and my hope is that we maintain all of it or certainly a significant amount of it we that's yet to be seen. But that changed the economics of the operating margin in the DIY business. Our focus whether it's 19% or 20% is to is to make sure that we're growing operating profit dollars at a good return. And sometimes our margin our operating margin might go down because I've said for many times if we could double our commercial business at a substantially lower operating margin. Tomorrow we would do it because it doesn't require a lot of capital and it would grow our operating profit dollars tremendously.Yes Iâ€™ll first start with you have to remember that our business is generally an inelastic business. Except for some reason whenever the low end consumer has excess cash we see a significant pop in our business. But I'll go back to what I said earlier we historically haven't seen it revert back to the norms. The look at our business in the quarter our retail business our transaction count was meaningfully better than it normally would be. We're also seeing that we grew share by 10% during the depths of the crisis and we are continuing to modestly grow share on top of that I would have anticipated we would give some of that back. We're not. And then you layer in the fact that there is this inflation and that's probably accelerating our growth by about 4%. We don't think that there's a lot of elasticity in that inflation at this point in time. The bigger question is the one that you're bringing up. If we continue to see significant inflation across the market does that put more and more pressure on particularly the low end consumer? And ultimately do we see a deceleration as a result of that? And I think that's a logical thesis. But we've had a lot of logical thesis during this pandemic that haven't come to fruition.Yes thank you very much Zack Happy Holidays to you too.Itâ€™s a great question Chris and I'm very happy that Jamere has not allowed us to reverse our long term history of not giving guidance. I don't know the answer to it right? Yes we'll be going up against the stimulus payment around the first of the year. Yes we're going to be something we've talked about a lot historically we'll be going up against a pretty significant weather event towards the end of our quarter and beginning of the next quarter. For us we're going to maximize our performance and optimize our performance in whatever sales environment we have. We don't have to change if we thought we were going to be plus two or down 2% on a historical basis we don't have to change how we operate. And if we left that stimulus and we have a little bit of a headwind for four weeks so be it. We're running this business for the long term. As I've said in the prepared remarks the valuation needs to be placed on this company depends on how our investors and particularly our long term investors feel our cash flow is going to be three to five years from now. And that's the lens that we're looking at. If we go through a tough quarter because our business is up 25% from pre pandemic so be it we need to make sure that we're making the investments today that allow us to continue to have this amazing cash flow generation for the long term.Thanks Brian.It's a great question Brian. I think the answer is yes but it's ever changing. And I want to stop for just a second and really say thank you to our supply chain team and our merchants. You talk about collaboration. These folks have been working unbelievably hard now for 20 months trying to figure out how we deal with this enormous surge in volume. So round numbers our business is up 25% or more since the pre pandemic level. Our supply chain our manufacturers and their supply chains nobody built for 25% excess capacity that would last for 20 months. Our teams have done a really really really good job of managing through it. That said we have challenges. Our in-stock levels are not where we want them to be. They haven't been the whole time. And they'll go down a little bit and they'll come up a little bit but we're generally 3% or 4% below the in-stock levels that we want on a weekly basis. To your point are we seeing things change that give us optimism about the future? And the answer is yes. But as soon as we do we see another part of the supply chain that is more challenged. In a lot of respects we're playing a little bit of Whack a Mole. In the beginning it was particular categories sandpaper. Now it's tools and brake rotors. We also back in the summer time we couldn't get capacity to get enough container loads from Shanghai to the U.S. Now it's can we get them through the ports in the U.S. and our team's done been really creative about getting the ships but now also finding different ports across the country to go to. So we are seeing it get better. But we are nowhere out of the woods on stage saying that next month we're going to be back into it. We're about to face Chinese New Year which is always a difficult time in any supply chain. So it'll be interesting to see how we manage through that. My hope is late spring early summer we get back to some semblance of normality. But every time we thought okay this one is easing there's been another part of the supply chain that has shown challenges.I think we already have Brian. I talked in my prepared remarks we're going to make the most significant investments that we've seen in our supply chain. Because we've seen this this surge in volume. Now I don't want to spook everybody. Our CapEx is going to be up $100 million $150 million kind of range over last year. And it â€“ but it will have an elevated level in our supply chain for a couple of years. And as we've talked about as a team think over the long term we've optimized our supply chain to the third decimal point when you've been through a surge in volume like we've experienced over the last 20 months that was probably a little pennywise and pound foolish. And so we're going to be a little bit more aggressive with our supply chain investments. We've clearly made a ton of investments in our commercial business over the last four years from inventory assortments to mega hubs and hubs to investments in the Duralast brand to investments in price investments in technology the single largest technology investment we've ever made as a company is what underpins this commercial strategy. And we're beginning to see benefits from it. But we've got a ton of benefits left in front of us on the commercial side of the business. So I think we've been making investments at an accelerated rate. And when you have the kind of profitability characteristics that we have today we're looking at are there other places that we can invest? I also want to say one place that we've invested very aggressively that I don't think others have done at nearly at the same level is we've invested in our people. We've invested in our people in accelerated wage rates. We've invested in our people and our culture through things like emergency time off. The last time I've tallied up what we'd invested from emergency time off vaccine incentives and those kinds of things. We were in the $135 million range. And then we announced again today that we added $9 million to our AutoZoners Assistance Fund. We believe in times like this if we're going to have values that we state it's imperative that we live consistent with those values. And I think we've walked that walk very clearly during the pandemic.All right. Thank you. Appreciate it Brian. So before we conclude the call I just want to take a moment to reiterate that we believe our industry is strong and our business model is solid. We'll take nothing for granted as we understand our customers have alternatives to shopping with us. We will continue to focus on the basics as we strive to optimize shareholder value for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Lastly we want to wish everyone a happy healthy and safe holiday season and a very prosperous new year. Thank you for your time today. Thank you for your interest in AutoZone. Take care,0.011722376,0.056109488,0.01985416
146,146,FTNT,Jensen:,Yes. I think the -- I probably want to check the numbers. I'm looking at a bookings number in the first quarter it was about $12.75 and a bookings number in the second quarter that I think we talked about thinking at the midpoint $13.55. So I don't know that I'm seeing a deceleration as that you may be concerned about.Yes. I think what we ended up on the full year number. Through all the analysis that we do I think the raise for the full year is roughly the beat that we had in the first quarter plus the raise that we had in the second quarter. And we sanity check that we're looking at our pipeline growth or sales capacity what we think the price increases are going to deliver some more metrics around the backlog and want to make sure that we getting too far ahead of ourselves and over our skis. And I think that's a pretty good number to be at right now in the current environment. There remains a lot of uncertainty as you know out there and getting overly bullish on Q3 and Q4 right now. I think we'd like to see how this plays out a little bit more.I don't -- I think it's pervasive. And I -- we look at the three different sources of pipeline the way we talk about the channel the marketing team and the direct sales force. I think we're pleased with the contribution from all three of them no doubt about that. We've talked for an extended period of time a few years about the importance of the channel and investments that we make and partnering with them and working together on that. And I think that the channel is holding up their side of the bargain as well. I think the marketing team give them a ton of credit. I love the Fortinet championship event and the continued success for it and how they've now leveraged that in other geographies as well. And the direct sales team continues to perform at a very high level and you're seeing the numbers. And obviously to the extent that you were able to continue to add headcount like the metric I gave earlier more people are going to drive more pipeline. So I don't know that I would isolate it to any one of those three areas of where it's coming from or even geographically. I mean it's been strong throughout. Ken I don't knowBen it's Keith. And just from a modeling point of view keep in mind that those price increases that we had in the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year that we get that lift in product revenue immediately. It takes a little bit longer to see it in the services line because of how the timing of rev rec. Then I think you're going to start to see between new sales and renewals the new price points that have been created for the services will start to have an impact and that's part of the acceleration that we talked about.Yes. I can't really quantify it. I just haven't looked at it that way. It's a good question a good approach. If I were to make informed judgments if you will I think that expansion is by far the largest opportunity for us. It's just the nature of the business. And I think the refresh and the competitive placements are probably fairly close to each other I would imagine for the remainder. There is refresh for us is we have a very long product suite. So we Ken will always have a new product. You saw the three new products come out be announced today. So there's always some sort of refresh activity in our own product that's going on there. But we -- I would also note that we are consistently getting more at bats if you will more opportunities with sales more competitive displacement. So I would imagine just my gut is again refreshing competitive displacements are probably in a similar neighborhood but expansion is the biggest.I think the backlog is being closer to 50-50 between networking equipment or I guess I should call it platform extension because it's in there and the firewalls or the core platform. I think it's kind of balanced out. I do think it's low-end FortiGates that are still dominating in the Fortinet space if you will. I don't remember quantifying early ordering as a percentage if you will. It's certainly something we've talked about here internally is our way of measuring that. And I think that's why we kind of provide -- Peter is going to give me some coaching here.Yes. I think the constraints if you will on that is more around when is the supply going to be available because it's in backlog we can deliver as soon as the supply arrives. But that's just more a function of how we're working with our suppliers or anything else.,0.003140608,0.003671348,0.000455286
147,147,JCI,Oliver:,Good morning Scott.Yes. So let me frame this up for you Scott. Number one I couldnâ€™t be more excited about the capabilities that FogHorn the software that they have brings to our OpenBlue platform. So you need to think about this as the edge AI is going to become a critical technology to own when it comes to the future of smart autonomous buildings and in many cases across other industries. And there is more value to being created at the edge because it can be real time it can be more dependable analytics. It reduces the data being sent to the cloud which is obviously lower cost more secure and it also improves the system resiliency. So it can operate whether it be offline or without connectivity. And so we see â€“ let me give you a number here. We see edge AI penetration increasing six-fold through 2025. So when you think about an autonomous building there will be more sensors more AI deployed more analytics. And by pushing that to the edge ultimately with the capabilities that I said earlier is what ultimately makes it really attractive. And so for us this was a buy versus build decision. We would have caused almost as much and probably would have had lengthened our development cycle another 2 years to establish the same level of the commercial success that FogHorn has today. And so you need to think of this as supplementing our product development for a product that we would have actually accelerated on our own spend. And then it catalyzes the creation what we would call our JCI AI Hub in Silicon Valley. Thatâ€™s where FogHorn is based. And itâ€™s allowing us to maintain the key engineering talent and now take what we were doing previously within JCI and put that together within the COE. And if you look at their capabilities compared to what we have seen elsewhere across the industry it is widely considered best-in-class and I would say has the most advanced portfolio among their peers. So this â€“ think of this Scott is this an accelerator of our ability to deploy our AI solutions with OpenBlue specifically to the verticals that we support that ultimately creates incredible value for our customers.They have an existing customer base where they were developing and developing vertical solutions. And so we have been working with them as Olivier said over the last year and so as they were advancing with their capabilities with our channel and the work that we are doing with OpenBlue just totally opened up the opportunity now to expand the market that they are serving.Thanks Scott.Thank you.Yes. Just a comment on that Nigel when you look at the backlog the backlog is up 12% year-on-year. When you look at HVAC controls we are up about almost 20%. And so you would attribute it to all of the strategies not only in the new product developments that are â€“ the new product thatâ€™s coming to market the focus on decarbonization on energy savings and now a significant lift on indoor air quality. And when you look at indoor air quality we are up nicely year-on-year after delivering $400 million in total. This would be across the globe last year. When we look at our orders here in Q2 we project those to be up about 45%. And so itâ€™s a combination of not only good core growth but now seeing the opportunity the way that we are executing on the growth vectors. And now when you look at even services being up nicely in North America that is an output of the work that we have been doing strategically.So when I look at the supply chain disruptions overall and it is weighted towards North America. It is driven by labor a broad base. Now what I would say inside our four walls so within our manufacturing facilities and within our install and service business we have been very effective in getting the ramp-up of labor that ultimately is required to continue to accelerate our growth. And so when you look at â€“ I mean the disruption that Olivier was talking about is really driven by our supply chain chips and coils and other components that ultimately we have been adjusting to and making sure we are working around to mitigate the impact. And so we have been very proactive not only on the labor front ourselves but we have been also engaged with our suppliers. And so we have been very actively engaged with their labor situation to make sure that we are utilizing our labor services to ultimately get the labor they need to be able to keep our manufacturing facilities operating and the like. And so what I would say it certainly is what I would say the underlying challenge within the supply chain. But I would tell you based on what I see we track this on a weekly basis we are making good progress and then we are working with our suppliers to do the same.Good morning Steve.Yes. I mean when we look at our applied business Steve and the work that we have done making sure that we have got a full lineup and we have been reinvesting in new product and the like. So I think we are seeing some upside from that. I think overall we have seen a nice recovery and we have capitalized on that with some of the new products. I would say the focus for us has been on low-GWP refrigerant technologies next-gen air cool technologies a lot of electrification with heat pumps and heat transfer units and then in our JCH business the VRF technology. So I think a lot of these are aligned to where we see the market going and ultimately now capitalizing on those trends around sustainability and energy efficiency. And so thatâ€™s the underlying what we see to be the â€“ driving the underlying demand. When you look at our performance in applied both sales and orders were up low-double digits in Q1. And now a lot of this was â€“ there is a few verticals driving this. We see strong demand in data centers and healthcare and thatâ€™s globally and thatâ€™s driving a lot of demand for our air cooled chillers specifically in North America. And then the other I think whatâ€™s helping this demand also is this the retrofit projects that are focused on sustainability decarbonization healthy buildings which ultimately brings together our combined capabilities beyond just the equipment. And so I think that whatâ€™s driving it to your question of how does that play out over the rest of the year. We believe as Olivier said not only with the underlying demand and now with the strong pricing activity that we are â€“ overall I think itâ€™s following the demand for the overall company which is high-single digits. And we see our backlog not only our order pipeline but then our backlog that we are developing continues to grow. And we have backlog today that now is up over 10%. So I think itâ€™s â€“ a lot of these demand streams converging that is ultimately playing out for us as we had planned with our strategy.Yes so let me just frame up OpenBlue because I think this is a very important fundamental. So itâ€™s really at the center of everything we are doing. So as we talked about today not only how we are pushing intelligence to the edge at our products and driving that now with FogHorn in our digital capabilities. But through all of this whether it would be OpenBlue Bridge OpenBlue Twin active responder Performance Advisor cloud location all of these capabilities then play out not only enhancing our ability to get more installed base but then differentiating that base with services. So we have launched these eight major offerings. We have now incorporated those into our digital services. And when you look at our digital products and service revenue we are up high-single digits. So that is tracking with the investments we made. And now itâ€™s really now embedded in selling it as a solution. So whether it be a project where we deliver energy savings or decarbonization or indoor air quality as a solution thatâ€™s embedded in the solution. And then within that solution we get higher margin and then we get a connection that gives us the ability to now add additional digital services. And so the benefit for the customer is improved uptime like by 66% higher efficiency smart buildings impact we can impact energy by 50%. And so all of our solutions are based on creating these outcomes that ultimately generate a return for our customers and we see this over time as we have said before up to 10x the value creation with how it differentiates our equipment the solutions that we install and then the base we build to allow us to be able to deliver additional services on top of that connection. That is the framework of OpenBlue.And Josh just to add when we look at our â€“ these new solutions that we have launched around net zero buildings and now the indoor air quality as a service. We have got a significant pipeline that we are now in the early stages of developing and beginning to convert. And that does begin to change not only the solutions and the installed base that is created with those solutions but that gives us the installed base to ultimately get connected and then ultimately build â€“ continue to build out the services. So I believe when you look at the full cycle we are seeing that with the projects that are in our pipeline and how we are beginning to convert. And thatâ€™s why as Olivier said we have been increasing our sales force because we believe that with all of the pluses and minuses that we are positioned for a nice steady stream of growth here that we are positioned to be able to deliver on.Yes. So if you look at our â€“ when we talk about labor at our facilities at our manufacturing facilities we have been managing around shortages and we are getting some disruption there because you have to run smaller lots through the manufacturing process and you have to do more changeovers per shift and the like. And thatâ€™s why we saw some disruption there. Why the field is greater is because when you look at North America for instance we have 18 000 people in the field every day on jobs. And so itâ€™s really based on schedules and making sure that we are deploying that labor efficiently that they are going to be able to perform their work when they go on site. And so you can imagine in this environment with all of the changes that are happening daily we are operating at an incredible level to maintain not only the full employment but ultimately supporting our customers during this period of time. And so I think the value proposition as we have been able to â€“ I just looked at our January numbers as far as our hiring and we are spot on what we need to hire to ultimately support the growth the rest of the year. And as we work with our recruiters and the way that we are presenting ourselves in the market there is a very attractive value proposition with the work we are doing with ultimately the growth that we are positioned to achieve and then ultimately the problems that now we are positioned to solve for our customers. So when you put all that together those are some of the drivers whatâ€™s driving our success. But to your point it is â€“ anyone thatâ€™s within the supply chain today there is a level of frustration because you â€“ every day you get a curveball and you have to work around because of the shortage or the like. And to your point about our customers we certainly are governed by the projects that we are supporting and ultimately their schedules on site. And we are trying to work that proactively so we donâ€™t get many surprises. But you can imagine when things donâ€™t show up then you have got to pivot and redeploy. And thatâ€™s â€“ we have been doing that extremely well while we have been navigating through this period of time.So let me wrap up and I will thank everyone again for joining our call this morning. As we have discussed here we have had a very strong start to the fiscal year and the underlying momentum we are seeing in our business and the recovery within our verticals is very encouraging. And although the environment will continue to be challenging as you have seen here our teams across the board are executing extremely well ultimately delivering for our customers and for our shareholders. So I would just like to end the call and thank Antonella again for just an incredible run and for your leadership your friendship and the impact that you have had on all of us and on the company has been phenomenal. So again thank you for that. And I do look forward to speaking with many of you soon. There is a lot of conferences coming up and we are looking forward to further engagement. So on that operator that concludes our call.,0.009252797,0.040615439,0.01402658
148,148,OXY,Hollub:,Yes Matt I'll let Richard take that.Yes. We still feel really good about what we're doing in the Gulf of Mexico for the next few years. As you know we've talked recently about the fulfilled development look at all the structures and the opportunities and high-graded and that we've already started now working on a subsea or subsurface pumping system that will enable us to increase production. Also we're doing some additional work around rescheduling some of our development opportunities based on the exploration success that we've had and that we see. So I think certainly we have the assets we have the permitting capability there to continue to maintain that cash flow over the next few years. Beyond that depends on some of the success of the exploration that we'll be executing this year and early next year.Yes. And my comments on that was definitely related to those who don't already have their plans in place and didn't already have their materials lined up to purchase. So anybody trying to increase activity at this point not only in the Permian but also worldwide would have a very difficult time being able to do that. And with respect to the macro I really don't think there's been a time since I've been in our industry where inventories and spare capacity are both very low. And then you couple that with the supply chain challenge. So I think that there are a lot of headwinds to increasing production worldwide. And there's never been a time I don't think either of that companies have been trying as hard as they can to increase production but we can't destroy value and it's almost value destruction if you try to accelerate anything now. And some of the longer-term projects just can't get started because of the cost involved. Now for those of us that had plans in place and there are other companies that have done this too but for those of us that plans in place and had this plan in place early enough we've been able to mitigate some of the impact of the inflation and I'll let Richard detail some of that.We don't share the discussions that we have with other shareholders as you know. But I can tell you that we always consider ways to add value to our shareholders and we'll continue to do that. So we really can't disclose any private conversations with other shareholders.Yes. This year we did have some things that we needed to catch up on. As you know we were at $2.9 billion last year and that didn't sustain some of our lower decline assets. So we are -- that's part of the reason that we have a little more OpEx in Permian. That is to restore some CO2 to some of our CO2 floods and also to do some workovers to get some wells back online. So as we're going toward forward and looking at what's the optimum level of capital for the -- these assets to deliver the most value we are taking into consideration what should we do where should we allocate capital to even the assets that in a sustainability scenario would be a lower capital. It's just that the lower decline assets take a little longer to catch up but then they don't decline as quickly. So if I'm understanding your question to get us to where we would continually be at a higher rate should happen going into next year. I think that we'll be where we need to be to have every -- the capital into every asset that we have optimized.I would say that that is probably a little higher than the sustaining rate. But it's the rate that we feel is appropriate on a go-forward basis to optimize the development within each of those portfolios. Our sustaining capital is still at that 3.2 in a $40 environment. So we have the increase in prices that comes with not being in the $40 environment. I should say we have on the waterfall we show you a little deflation as costs go back down to a cycle that looks more like $40 than where we are today. So there's an uplift in costs associated with that. And then there's the $250 million that we put into the CapEx for this year that's more related to inflation albeit we're trying to offset $50 million of that. But that's also dollars that are not going into delivering incremental oil it's just to pay the cost due to inflation. So it is at the rate that going next year would be at a rate that should deliver year-over-year a little bit of an increase in production.I would say Paul on the midstream business because of all the uncertainties in the world and there are a lot of those we've taken a very conservative approach on our forecast for pricing of sulfur and NGLs mainly. And with that I want to say I very much appreciate all the calls today and I want to thank our employees for their commitment and their exceptional performance that's been able to help us resume our delivery of return on capital employed and of capital to shareholders. So have a good day. Thank you.,0.006686568,0.010607719,0.003209103
149,149,ADSK,Anagnost:,Yes. Excellent question Adam. So as you know Upchain is PLM and PDM Product Data Management and Product Lifecycle Management in the cloud. So it's a fully cloud native application. It's got both Product Data Management and PLM. It understands both files and cloud information models like what power fusion for example. Our vision for how this is going to work if Fusion already has a stack built on its cloud information model that goes all the way through simple data management up through into Product Lifecycle Management. Upchain will likely replace that capability within Fusion over time. But more importantly what Upchain does is it supports a whole swath of legacy applications from our competitors and from other places. So what we're going to do is we're going to go into counts with legacy applications or where we see overlap with other applications and combined a Fusion stack and the Upchain stack to handle the whole swath of data our customers use. Now ultimately as well what we're going to do is we're going to integrate Upchain with Vault so that Vault can now have a extension to the cloud. We're not going to force our Vault users to move from on-prem to the cloud. Vault is a very popular application we sell a lot of it every quarter and we're going to continue to update and maintain it. You might've noticed that we just released mobile and extension to it in some web extent â€“ additional web extensions capability for Vault. So we continue to drive Vault but we are going to integrate Vault and Upchain over time which will give our Vault customers a path to putting all their data in the cloud as they see fit to do it. But we're not going to force that migration. So look for it to replace the guts of Fusion lifecycle over time and integrate with Fusion cloud information model and look for it to integrate with Vault over time and provide a path for Vault customers to the cloud. And then ultimately look for us to be going after legacy systems with a combination of our Fusion offering and Upchain capability to bring all the customer's data and all the applications the customer use together in one robust cloud environment.Yes. We have really high expectations for how that business progresses as the year progresses and we're getting â€“ we're definitely getting some good indications. One of the things we watch are the bid the activity on Bid Board through our BuildingConnected service. That activity has been going up in Q1. It's been progressively going up each month which is great. So we see a lot of activity heading into there. Just like a lot of our businesses we expect some of the new business to be backend loaded but we're super happy with where we are right now. We had a good launch of Autodesk Build it's getting good take-up and monthly active usage from some of our customers new customers are embracing it. Our international expansion efforts that we put on hold last year because of the pandemic are now moving into full gear this year. Later this year we rollout Autodesk Build to the channel and that's going to accelerate Buildâ€™s business. And one of the things I just want to highlight is why we're winning okay and why we continue to win business and why we're so incredibly confident about the future. Here's what customers tell us right. The end-to-end solution that we offer all the way from planning early planning through design through pre-construction through pre-construction planning to site execution all the way to digital handoff to actual maintenance and operations of the asset. Nobody has this especially to the depth that we have in each one of those disciplines. The other thing that people are really excited about is the deep integration with BIM and in fact that it's a BIM-native platform. It speaks BIM from the get-go it will always speak BIM and it's really good at it. This is driving more and more displacement in competitive solutions and accounts where we overlap. And one of the other big things that we hear from customers is our business model flexibility all right. Customers love that they can buy from us where they need to buy from us and how they need to buy from us all right. If you need a project-based license we've got it. If you need a consumption-based model we got it. If you need a per-user model we got it. We adapt and flex our business model to whatever the particular customer's needs are or their ecosystems needs are. And we can do it anywhere in the world. So if we're dealing with an international customer they know that when they standardize on us they can get everywhere with the solution we do. So that's why we're winning. That's why we're bullish as we move into the next year and why we're excited about the construction market becoming hot and active again. The digitalization of this market a multi-year trend there's lots of opportunity for lots of people and we're seeing lots of validation in the direction we're heading. And I think it's going to be an exciting year for digital construction.Well there's a lot of things. One there's the increased interest in the cloud all right. There's the simple network effect of people saying you know what I displaced my Mastercam solid works with Fusion and you should try that too. It's awesome. So we're getting that network effect of people basically encouraging each other to move forward and get off the legacy systems and move to the cloud with Fusion. So we're seeing some of that. We're also seeing and this is super important. We're seeing increased purchases within accounts we penetrated previously which means we're moving from kind of being a niche solution inside these companies or maybe a partially piloted solution to production. And that's also an important driver. And we expect these trends to continue this year and continue moving forward. And one of the really exciting things about this as we talk about growth beyond FY2023 and into FY2024 and FY2025 beyond the early success we're seeing in Fusion right now is going to be a growth engine that continues to accelerate over the next five years. Especially as we start introducing our new design our extensions we already have one for advanced manufacturing. We have various other extensions. There's going to be new extensions in the second half of the year. Those extensions continue to be out there. We're particularly excited that we sold more Fusion than other applications in Q1 without any type of promotional activity. All of this points towards increasing customer demand for what we're doing.I'm sorry could you â€“ you want to have a little bit for me on the last part of that the part of the question what's the key point the question here sorry.Yes. Okay. So as I've said many times license compliance is one of these areas that we're just going to build a steady drum beat on all right. It's going to be the gift that keeps giving for years and years to come. We do not want to accelerate it unnaturally because we want to bring our customers along with us. We want to keep them happy help them get compliant. You notice the story that I offered up in Indonesia about that customer actually buying premium subscription as well as becoming compliant and being happy about how they were able to deploy it. That's the kind of outcomes we want from this solution. So we did see some acceleration. You saw the growth numbers in the opening commentary around non-compliant billings in Q1. But that was off of a Q1 that was previously off. So we had a really strong compare. Don't expect any hockey sticks though the Q1 of this year was better than the Q1 of fiscal 2020. So you're seeing continued growth which is what we want to see is nice steady growth in this business. But don't look for any hockey sticks this year. We're back to the path we were on previously.Youâ€™re welcome.Matt that's a very astute observation all right. It's too early to say the cost of â€“ the increases in cost of material is driving increased focus on digitization. But it is one of those things that we have constantly highlighted as one of the reasons why the value chain for construction needs to digitize because when material prices have gone up the way they have you can't afford to over purchase in waste materials. So I can't tell you precisely if this is one of the pipeline drivers. But I can tell you that we're mentioning it to customers and we're having with customers about hey conversations with customers. You want to keep your material costs down digitize right. Plan for less waste only order what you need. So it's definitely entering into the conversation. I think it's too early to say if it's driving acceleration in the pipeline. But I think it's likely that it is.Matt I'll just reinforce some of the things that Debbie said because I don't think we can talk about this enough because â€“ did you notice the list of things she gave there right. There's a whole set of horizontal things just around the normal business the non-compliance the new types of subscription models the rollouts of consumption the accelerating growth in our end markets. All of that combined also with the strategic levers around digitization in AEC around the convergence of design and make of what we're seeing with Fusion and then the whole move into new adjacencies that we're doing. Any one of those things could contribute to viable long-term growth. We have all of those levers to pull. All right I just want to remind we have all those levers to pull. And in August we're really good at picking and choosing the levers to pull when we need to pull them.Yes. So nobody is moving from Inventor to Fusion right now okay. It's just not happening all right. It's actually â€“ most of the businesses about going after incremental seats inside of competitive accounts especially down market. The one great thing about our strategy is most of the Inventor is bought through collections which includes Fusion. So if an Inventor user does start to move to Fusion over time they continue on the same subscription path we'll do. And what we'll do with our collections is some of the extensions that would be available to a vanilla Fusion user that they have to pay for would be included with the collections version. So essentially what you see is a kind of an AFP neutral conversion from Inventor to Fusion but that's going to take a long time. Most of the Inventor customers are going to stay comfortably where they are. But when they do move it's essentially AFP neutral in terms of impact on our ARR. It doesn't change the ARR trajectory not materially.Yes. So right now Jason we're going to stay focused on road and rail and bridges and the things that go along with road and rail and water that's going to be our focus area. There's a lot of exciting things happening with elastic grid designs and the electrification and things associated with that. We're not going to be focusing on that right now. We may in the future but right now if you look at â€“ even if you look at where the infrastructure bill is going for instance. Most of it is going to the upgrading and expanding the deteriorating infrastructure we have in the company around road rail bridges civil and water infrastructure. And that's going to be our sweet spot for awhile â€“ wins in that respect.Yes. A lot of the TAM is greenfield. Really sometimes what you're competing with here is some kind of free tool and excel spreadsheets or a lack of any digital process whatsoever beyond emailing PDFs right. So there's a lot of greenfield opportunity here in addition to kind of just flipping existing customers off of legacy systems or consolidating their systems. So there is a very robust long tail of growth here that's going to go on for years. That's why it's so exciting to see all the activity in this space because it's going to take a village to deal with digitize this entire market and we're at the very very early stages of this which is great.Yes. Excellent question Gal. As you know Gal Autodesk Build and the Construction Cloud in general is the unification of all those brands and it's where we leave with new customers. Absolutely when we're going out there chasing new businesses Autodesk Build it's all the capabilities that are built into Autodesk Build itâ€™s Autodesk Takeoff itâ€™s all of those tools associated with the Construction Cloud and that's where we lead. But we're also seeing people migrate off of the individual brands and move forward all right. So we're seeing the same kind of thing happening incrementally. But that's not â€“ we're going to let those people move at their own pace right. So when they're choosing to move on to the consolidated cloud they're doing that by choice. And as part of a process over time we will ultimately migrate all of them to Construction Cloud and Autodesk Build. But right now we're leading it with our new customers of Autodesk Build and helping customers consolidate on the Autodesk Build when they want to bring some of those old brands along with them. But all the best technology from all those brands is in the Construction Cloud now.,0.007554372,0.016938448,0.006395149
150,150,PSA,Russell:,Yes. Smedes I mean I wouldnâ€™t say that weâ€™ve holistically pivoted or taken a different approach to the way that weâ€™ve been investing. We continue to look for opportunities just as I outlined relative to the quality of the assets that weâ€™re bringing to the portfolio the opportunity that we can say from -- that we can see from driving returns based on our performance and then putting them into our own platform what kind of success factors weâ€™ll see from there the additive scale that weâ€™re going to get in any particular market. So because of some of the shifting that weâ€™re seeing we havenâ€™t stepped back and said where weâ€™re going to be out of the market or weâ€™re going to shift down relative to our approach to betting and looking at assets that make sense to come into the portfolio. Thereâ€™s a fair amount of competitive activity. But believe me the team is working hard. Weâ€™re very busy underwriting assets. And thereâ€™s a lot of competitive activity playing through. Thereâ€™s always a tipping point that weâ€™re very cognizant of where we feel an asset may or may not bring forth the relative returns best on a price that it may trade for us. So weâ€™re going to be very reflective of that too. But overall weâ€™re still seeing opportunities. And weâ€™re very optimistic about what can continue to play through. As Tom mentioned our balance sheet continues to be in very strong shape. Weâ€™re sitting on $1 billion of cash. This year weâ€™re likely to generate another $600 million to $700 million in free cash flow. So very well positioned to continue to grow the portfolio and seeing very good asset opportunities and weâ€™ll continue to vet them.Yes. Spencer itâ€™s any and all of the typical buyers that are out in the market. So thatâ€™s a pretty commonplace component of the third-party platforms whether theyâ€™re the platforms you see through the public operators and thereâ€™s a fair amount of private third-party management platforms as well. So the trading activity that can take place within those platforms can come from either a public operator private equity private investors. So itâ€™s pretty typical of just the overall range of buying activity that takes place. Weâ€™ve -- typically even before we got in the third-party management business typically bought a fair amount of assets out of different third-party platforms. Last year that -- we also bought a number of assets out of our own third-party management platform. In the first quarter we bought one. But there is a fair amount of trading that goes on in these platforms some of which is tied to structurally the reasons many of these assets are on these platforms as theyâ€™re being teed up to do just that. The owners may not look at their own ownership for long periods of time. Theyâ€™re looking for certain levels of optimization. Theyâ€™ll get the asset to that point and theyâ€™ll take back right out of the market to trade. So very typical kind of the overall dynamics of what happens with third-party management.Sure Caitlin. Yes. And I would tell you that as weâ€™ve spoken to over the last several quarters some of the headwinds that seem to be containing the amount of volume of new development we feel is a good thing in one way meaning thereâ€™s elevated risk going in any development opportunity. And I canâ€™t name a city for instance nationally that is easier to deal with today than it was pre-pandemic. City staffs are constrained from a staffing standpoint from a timing standpoint the complexity to get through both entitlement and then construction processes are very elevated. And with that thereâ€™s more risk at hand at a time when weâ€™re seeing component costs increase in some cases pretty dramatically whether itâ€™s steel labor concrete. And then with that interest rates are still far from stable. In fact theyâ€™re accelerating. So very different risk factors that create some pretty meaningful headwinds. So the development business is still active however I mean still 500 to 600 properties likely to come into the market this year and next. To your point obviously some of thatâ€™s being driven by the overall success of the sector and the amount of demand that weâ€™re seeing for self-storage but thereâ€™s a healthier level of discipline thatâ€™s playing through for many of the factors that I spoke to. Itâ€™s been a good window for our development team to continue to do what youâ€™re seeing us do which is to grow our own pipeline. Weâ€™re seeing less competitive activity for certain land sites in certain markets. Weâ€™re able to capture opportunities because weâ€™ve got the scale the efficiency and the opportunity deflect to some degree some of the pressure points that I just spoke to. But if youâ€™re a first-time developer or a developer that doesnâ€™t have the wherewithal to potentially deal with these risk factors youâ€™re probably going to be a lot more conservative and -- we think that overall as I mentioned thatâ€™s a good thing for the industry.Yes. So weâ€™ve seen continued adoption of eRental. Now over 50% of our customers are using that channel from an election standpoint. Weâ€™re not pushing them to it but theyâ€™re actually electing to choose self-directed digital leasing process. By virtue of that at our own frontlines and the amount of time that our property managers in particular historically would have spent on that specific move-in process when youâ€™re seeing the effects of potentially 50-plus-percent of that coming out of the labor demand property to property itâ€™s pretty powerful. It gives us the opportunity to redirect priorities relative to the utility of the property management team the things that theyâ€™re focused on the efficiencies that can play through when half or more of their customer activity is actually being self-directed and done on a digital basis. So itâ€™s a pretty powerful tool. Youâ€™re seeing some of that through the cost efficiency and our labor even though labor costs are up but thereâ€™s continued benefit that we see from increasing the amount of digital options that weâ€™re giving customers. And frankly weâ€™re getting very good feedback from customers who use that tool as well. Itâ€™s a growing and preferred alternative to actually transact. Itâ€™s a much more consistent experience and it can give the customer even that much more flexibility when they choose to move in to a specific property. So all things considered itâ€™s been a very powerful tool and weâ€™re continuing to look at different ways of utilizing it and expanding its use again depending on customer choices.Yes Mike. Whatâ€™s typical in the way that we approach land is weâ€™re looking primarily for opportunities where weâ€™re not directly putting land inventory right onto our balance sheet. Itâ€™s pretty typical or the types of opportunities that weâ€™re sourcing give us the flexibility as a buyer to actually take the site through layers or stages of entitlements that happen on their ownership time. Itâ€™s the obligation they give us or the time we take to actually take the property through reentitlement without actually owning the site. So contractually thatâ€™s a pretty typical approach. Itâ€™s not each and every time but more often than not weâ€™re taking a land site through certain layers of entitlements before we actually take ownership to not only reduce risk but to contain costs as well. And with the amount of knowledge efficiency and resources that we put into these processes by far the majority of the landowners that weâ€™re doing business with are agreeable to that kind of approach. So with that weâ€™re not holding large land positions. And with -- and more frequently weâ€™re going to acquire a site when itâ€™s much more closer to the ability or the timing to actually start construction.Yes. Mike I would say it aligns exactly to the timing youâ€™re talking about. So market-to-market youâ€™ve got some processes that might take you a year or two. Youâ€™ve got others that could take three or four. And believe it or not some that could even be longer than that. So weâ€™re matching that up. And contractually we have control of the sites before weâ€™re starting to invest and deploy resources and time into those sites. So weâ€™ve got control of the land sites themselves. So -- and it matches to exactly what youâ€™re speaking to. So if you think about the pipeline that we have today there are components of that pipeline that those land sites are going through the exact same sets of processes that I spoke to. So we may not have actually acquired the land site itself in certain of those cases but we have full contractual ability to control the site. And once we get through the entitlement process weâ€™ll take ownership.,0.003230914,0.005033076,0.001040691
151,151,ECL,Beck:,Yes it's an interesting one Vincent because for the most part the retail industry is doing quite well especially the large customers the large retailers that we are serving around the country and around the world. The trick is that they are all struggling with how much people they get obviously in their stores so they need to choose where the people are going ultimately. They go and serve customers or do they do as well as much as they should. So on the the cleaning side as well I want to be careful how I'm saying that obviously because we make sure that our customers are doing things the right way. But in normal times they would do much more than what they're doing today. And it's all related to the staffing that the shifting are from one part of the store towards the commercial one which is driving their stays as well.So two parts of you few questions obviously. So margins and mix. So if I talk about overall margins usually it takes two years to kind of get through the margin cycle. So our inflation goes up and we get the pricing we get the dollars back to the first year and the second year we get the margins back and more and that's how we've grown our margins in industrial so at every cycle. And it's going to be the same in this one with one big difference is that usually the inflationary cycle will last much less time this time well we're already planning for two years last year and this year. So the cycle is going to be a little bit longer but a very strong price muscle in industrial for a few reasons first because our premium products are competitive versus competition in terms of what they can deliver. So our customers are interested in paying more to get more as well out of it. And second we have a pricing approach which is driven by eROI as you probably know which is basically getting a share of the savings that we are generating for our customers as well. So it's kind of a very natural organic type pricing as well. So the underlying pricing and then you have the inflation pricing that comes on top of it. So bottom line should be towards '23 I think that assuming that inflation obviously peaks now and eases in the quarters to come in '23. So we should really see so that rebuild and step up in margins in Industrial. That was your second question. The first one was the mix. There's three things. One is business mix. If you have paper for instance so growing faster than like water paper is at lower margin than like Water. Well that has an impact in the mix of businesses. Within a business you can take downstream for instance we have an important offering which is called additives that energy companies are using usually when the prices of oil are rather high because they can afford it. Well those ones are growing really fast right now. They have lower margin than the chemical offering that we're providing to those customers. And the last one is the country mix as well. So depending on where you grow that has an impact as well on the overall margin of Industrial. So those are the three big drivers of this margin mix.So two things Kevin and I can explain it in a complicated way and a very simple way. I'll take the simple one and we can get obviously some more in detail if you wish so. But the way we agree and align with customers in such a short period of time is really to make sure that the surcharge is an offset to the increase of commodity costs related to energy cost. So you get a net zero ultimately on our EPS delivery. But if we don't get the surcharge obviously we have a negative EPS delivery because we get the inflation and we don't get the surcharge. So that's the way we think about it really that the surcharge is a natural offset so for the increase related to the energy costs. So that's the first one. And the second and I'll pause after that so just to make sure that I addressed your question here. The second quarter ending June as you say Well it's a transition quarter because obviously we start from zero on April 1st and we hope to be as close to kind of -- in cruising speeds in June or July which is why I'm not perfectly accurate on where we're going to be at the end of June because there's a lot of realization that needs to happen for those thousands of customers millions of locations around the world in 170 countries. This is real work. It's evolving very nicely very well. I like the progress that we're making but it's an imperfect journey obviously since we've never done it as well. So that's the way we think about it in terms of net impact an offset for the second quarter well it's not going to be a straight line to heaven but it's going to end up in a good place sometime this summer. I don't know if it's going to be exactly at the end of June when the quarter ends.So just to make sure I get you right so you're talking about -- you want me to talk about sales or margin or both?Well actually so sales were really good. They could have been even better if omicron wouldn't have hit to the first part of the quarter. And the earnings were good but they're still not as high as they could or should be because they've been impacted as well by the delivered product cost inflation. So good growth good productivity work. You maybe remember that we've implemented in 2020 a global field system as well that is really automating a big chunk of the transactional work that our field force is doing around the world that's driving better productivity. Innovation is adding to margin as well. We mentioned Ecolab Science Certified disinfection programs as well related to COVID and post COVID as well. Thatâ€™s all helping on the margin. But the truth it's going to happen in the quarters to come and probably as well in the years to come. Because when all that comes together that the pricing gets ahead as well of inflation I firmly believe that the institutional margins will be even better after that cycle than it was pre-COVID whenever the past is going to be or the future is going to be but let's assume it's going to be '23. But Institutional on a very good path both on top line and bottom line as well and the best is to come.So that's an imperfect science obviously. So it was -- when we look at all the sanitizing sales that we have in the company it grew over 50% during the COVID times. And the way it looks like right now is that it should remain at roughly 20% above where it was pre-COVID let's call it 2019As mentioned before so Institution is going to be better after that cycle concludes let's assume so '23 COVID inflation and all that. It's not all going to happen on January 1st obviously. But post this cycle the business performance the P&L of Institutional is going to be better than it was in 2019 of pre-COVID. That's the first one for all the reasons I mentioned on the prior question. On Industrial we've had a very good journey of margin improvement over the years. And interestingly enough also happening during those inflationary cycles we had the previous one. You maybe remember the margin improvement we had in 2020 was growing north of 20% in terms of operating margin and ended up in a very good place which is why I just mentioned before as well earlier on the call even the margins are down 10% in Q1 they're higher at 19% than they were in 2019 as well. So due to the pricing mix work that the team has been doing. So that's going to continue going forward. What you mentioned as well on net zero is obviously something that was much less relevant a few years ago but that's becoming very relevant right now and going forward because many of our customers have made commitments on the sustainability objectives. Many of them are not progressing as fast as they were hoping for a bunch of good and less good reasons sometimes. This is obviously driving very good demand. So for us we've created a dedicated Net Zero division now within Industrial in order to serve those customers as well that are the most advanced. And those customers tend to be higher margin as well at the same time which will help contribute as well to better margins for Industrial which down the road I expect Industrial to reach the same level of margin than Institutional and potentially even better.So I had to get to some numbers in order to get that. I want to make sure I get the right one. So from top line perspective we're way ahead of 2019 already obviously but you asked the right question so in terms of volume. So if you look at Q1 '22 we have businesses that are already ahead of 2019. Industrial is ahead Healthcare & Life Sciences ahead our Other segment is ahead as well. And the only one that's below 2019 roughly 10% in terms of volume is Institutional & Specialty and is expected to cross that line during the second half of the year where we're going to be in a place where all businesses I mean all major businesses will be ahead of 2019 in terms of volume during the second half of the year.Absolutely especially in Institutional & Specialty no doubt about that. That's why we're saying it's going to take -- it's kind of a two three year cycle where demand is going to be higher just because the industry is recovering from a demand perspective and staffing as we talked about before as well as you get more staffing in hotels for instance you've probably been in hotels lately so the service is a little bit different than it used to be even though you're paying the same prices for your rooms well it's not because hotels won't have it that way they don't have staffing to do it. That's going to add as well. So to the demand for us because those people are using our product that's going to be a good thing and that's going to help us drive demand in '22 and in '23. When it's going to stop? I don't know but I think we have one or two years ahead of us of recovery which is really good for that business.So first getting it all done in one quarter the short answer is no. And that's why I'm saying that in theory if everything were done in the second quarter in a perfect way yes we would be growing our earnings very nicely. Well it's not going to happen because we started zero on April 1st and at the end of June we won't be 100% done either for all the reasons that you're mentioning. And that's why it's hard to know exactly where we're going to be. But I know that this summer let's put it that way we will be in a very good place because all businesses everyone around the world so needs to get this one done at the right way. So exactly for the reasons that we mentioned before. And the second point on the [prioritization] of new business versus pricing we've been reasonably good at that. But I want to be perfectly honest with you. When we focus on pricing let alone the surcharge which is something totally new since we've never done that globally. Well you get your eyes off the ball of new business. So I expect plan to slow down a little bit to get the pricing right but that's why we want to get pricing done as quickly as we can to make sure that new business maintains momentum as well down the road it's hard to do both at the same time.Yes a few things. First that kind of inflation none of us has really experienced that. I guess our parents did. I was not in business. So last time it truly happened here 30 or 40 years ago. so it's totally extreme totally unusual as we all know. So a few things here. First we don't see a slowdown of demand yet. So that's a good news. But if we look at restaurants especially in the US if I look at the data that we get from the industry you clearly see a slowdown of demand which is most probably related to inflationary pressure because of oil because of COVID because of mortgages you name it. But that's very early. So those are indications that are probably so important to follow. The third thing and last thing that I'd say as well here is that when we move through slower times or more extreme recessionary times which we don't assume it's going to happen in '22 could happen in '23 who knows obviously that we've gone through many times as a company. And the good thing with the Ecolab model is that yes the growth slows down but we are still ahead of the market growth because we gained market share because we've all been discussed before in terms of new business innovation expansion of offering and so on there. So that helps us grow faster than the overall market and kind of dampen the recession that we might have on our top line. And most importantly in more difficult times for our customers they need us more because our value proposition as you know is helping customers get better results at the lower total cost that's been true for 99 years as a company. So in more difficult times potentially recessionary times customers need even more what we're doing which have been so reasons why Ecolab has been doing so quite well during slower or recessionary times.Absolutely it's a fascinating business which used to be part of like industries our water business that was serving hotels like manufacturing and so on. And now we've created a dedicated division that combines data centers and microelectronics. Obviously they're related but different. The main driver for data centers is to help those high tech companies reach their net zero ambition. And I mean you know all of them they've all made bold commitments that by 2030 for most of them they want to be zero or positive carbon and the same for water as well. We're the only company that can provide that to them so that's obviously something we had to get organized in order to get there. And we're making very nice progress by working with those large companies. This is Ecolab at its best because we serve enterprise customers for a very long time forever actually. And we have them understand where are they today how much water do they use what's the objective to get to zero what's the road map to get there and drive execution as well towards that while we make sure that we maintain a 99.9% uptime so for all data centers. Then microelectronics just to conclude on that is different but related. We wanted to have the same people because it's the same type of expertise that we need in the field. Well it's a production of microprocessors and that requires high purity high quality water which to a certain extent we were doing in the past Ecolab but we could not do the highest quality of water that's being used in the production process of microprocessors. This is something that we can do now with Purolite which is the new offering that no one else can offer as well which is helping not only Purolite but our global high tech business. So kind of the beginning of the journey. But so far a very good story where I think that we're in a position that we could truly own that market.So Life Sciences has been a great business that we started I think five years ago 2016. But Doug who we did that. So again I'm not going to take any credit for that. It's been a great business that's been growing to almost $300 million today growing double digit some of the highest margin that we have in the company. And it's a business that's doing well is having hard comps versus '21 and '20 because it was such a crazy high growth that that business went through related to COVID demand. But the underlying growth of that business is double digit and will emerge double digits in Q2 or Q3 I don't remember exactly and will continue very nicely as well as the business. On top of it because Life Science former Ecolab if I may say was really providing solutions to make sure that production lines clean rooms factories were safe and protected from any infection risk. Now we add Purolite obviously to it which is purifying the product that's being produced in those production lines. So it creates a one plus one equals three type of proposition like water and food safety when we acquired Nalco as well. So it's going to help Life Sciences grow even faster. Today together so it's kind of $700 million $800 million growing double digit. We are constrained by capacity right now as mentioned earlier on the call of the first year first half of this year roughly. But the demand is just getting higher. Two businesses doing really well. Getting together the offering is even more interesting. We just need to be able to produce what we're selling and that's going to happen during the second half of this year.We do that's where we focus on. So Life Science Rosemarie is 80% plus pharma and the balance is cosmetics the traditional brands. But Life Science for the most part is pharma with now a renewed focus on biopharma on mRNA and monoclonal antibodies which is really the industry within pharma that's growing the fastest and expected to be 40% of the overall pharma market by 2026 or 2027 so in the next few years are really interesting.Well it's what we've announced a few weeks ago or a month ago I don't remember exactly the timing. I might ask maybe Scott if you want to give some perspective as well on that.I'm really pleased with what we've done in pricing. So let's keep in mind we have to overcome $1 billion over $1 billion over 18 months so starting some mid last year towards the end of this year. So 18 months is a very short period of time as well. And we want to make sure that we do that in achieving two things. The first one is that we stay or get ahead of the inflationary curve. We've done it last year. We'll do it as well so this year as mentioned. We were on a path. So to be now basically ahead of the inflationary curve in 2022 that was prewar in Eastern Europe. Now it's postponed a few months but add the energy surcharge to that and we'll get to the right place as well. So it's on one hand making sure we cover inflation and at the same time that we do it in a way that we grow our margins as well down the road. Second objective we have is to make sure we're not losing customers. While we do that it's not a 100% play obviously but that we can maintain 90% plus of our customers which we're doing. We haven't lost any major customers while we were doing that because we need to keep in mind that we're a growth company. I want to make sure we keep our organic momentum which is extremely strong right now while we get the pricing right while we keep the customers because down the road that's the beauty of the Ecolab model when your fundamentals are right of new business of innovation of pricing of customer retention and that inflation eases you get very significant windfall in margin which we know always happens. The question is when is it exactly going to happen. But so far so good. I'm very pleased with what the team has been doing in terms of pricing while keeping the customers and driving growth at the same time.,0.003034333,0.004179835,0.000493093
152,152,EL,Travis:,Yeah. Yeah. Thanks Dara. In terms of -- we are encouraged obviously as we should be by our Q1 performance. We're still only at quarter end as you mentioned as you mentioned it. We did have some early shipments in the quarter that obviously came out of the second quarter. So some of the growth as we mentioned about 1.5 was related to that. But as we look at the balance of the year we are -- also while we're seeing encouragement there's still a lot of volatility in the market. We did have some markets unexpectedly that were shut down in the first quarter. We are still managing through this pandemic. And so we are -- we believe that certainly as you look at Q2 on a 2-year stock basis it is -- and really versus pre-pandemic it's really quite strong. And again you're seeing some of the seasonality related to 11-11 continue to impact Q1 and that's reflected in the -- Q2 and that's reflected in the guidance that we've provided. But we feel that the guidance that we've given for the year is incredibly strong. The only difference between the guidance that we gave last time and this time is currency. Our outlook on currency is a bit less. So that's the 1 point change in the guidance that you see. And then from a reported EPS standpoint our guidance actually on a constant currency basis has improved quite a bit. We -- I would say we are seeing green shoots we are expressing confidence in the guidance that we are providing quite a bit when you actually look at it from an EPS standpoint even with all of the things that we're navigating through as it relates to transport etc. And that goes to the choices that we're making as an organization in terms of where to invest and where not to invest along with the pricing actions that we're taking as well.Yeah. Now so Steve in terms of the early shipments obviously our larger brands would have comprised most of the larger -- most of the sales dollar volume in terms of those shipments but it was really across the board. And again both we and our retailers wanted to make sure that we had our holiday programs as well as some of our basic product in-store recognizing the severe constraint that is being projected as it relates to transport during this holiday season. So we feel very good about that. In terms of Asia-Pacific inclusive of China but other markets as well. We did see some intermittent shutdowns in Asia and that did include some traffic to Haibeing a bit curtailed in the July and August time frame and a bit into the early part of September. We saw as we mentioned in our prepared remarks Haipicked up quite a bit when those travel restrictions were lifted almost immediately. That is a positive sign and we are still quite encouraged with respect to China and the performance that we expect to see certainly for the balance of the year both in China and Mainland China and with Chinese consumers wherever they shop.And Andrea as it relates to the rest of APAC we are expecting a pickup in the second quarter so we are not anticipating as many of the restrictions to be in place in the rest of APAC that we saw in Q1.Thanks Wendy. In terms of La Mer La Mer is growing in pretty much every market. It's incredibly strong the brand does a fantastic job of innovating and so we're seeing growth from both new innovation as well as a continued expansion of new consumers with some of the strategies that the brand is deploying. And we see very high loyalty and repeat with La Mer it is all around even during this pandemic it has been one of the constants in terms of the performance in our portfolio and the La Mer team is just an absolute fantastic team. So the brand is doing incredibly well. As it relates to Kohl's and Target and also within target and Sephora within Kohl. We have seeded the initial doors. We certainly expect during the upcoming holiday season that we will see increased growth obviously in contribution from the distribution that we have and we're pleased thus far with the partnership. We're seeing more skin care growth and than makeup at the moment. But again I expect that we will certainly with some of the strong gift programs that our makeup brands have we expect that we'll see more makeup growth in the second quarter.I think this quarter really represents the diversification that we have within the business that we've talked about. And certainly the North America performance to Fabrizio's point represents that as well.,0.003818989,0.004351914,0.000377068
153,153,AJG,Patrick,Gallagher: And also let me remind you back in 2007 â€˜08 â€˜09 and this is just an incredible support of this model again. Youâ€™d think oh my gosh itâ€™s going to be our clients will stop paying their people before they stop paying their insurance bill. Thatâ€™s how important we are to them. Thatâ€™s a good spot to be.Gallagher: Thanks Greg.Gallagher: Hi Elyse.Gallagher: Iâ€™ll let Doug answer the actual number piece on that because a lot of thatâ€™s mathematical. But in terms of what Iâ€™m seeing for the year Iâ€™m not seeing â€“ Iâ€™m not anticipating significant change in the operating environment over the next three quarters.Gallagher: Yes. I will do that Lisa. Itâ€™s really been an amazing and letâ€™s remember as we finished the quarter we are four months in. So as we have this call we are close to five months. But I will tell you that the team we are not losing people we are not losing clients. Our renewals have been fantastic. Tom myself others at the table have had a chance to meet with reinsurance clients. They continue to be very open about the fact that they are glad. That they are â€“ there is not one less competitor in the marketplace. They are also very clear with us that the reason that the business held together over the years of discussion as to where this business was going to land was because of the people handling their business. And those people are still in place. Our losses in terms of people out the door are minimal to zero. And so when I look at it I am really really happy about it. And new business pipeline is strong. What I am very excited about is the integration that we are seeing or the sharing of information from our retail. Everybody said at the beginning why is this good for retail. And people also would ask why does reinsurance care what you are doing as a retailer. Well I will tell you what. There is so much going back and forth right now in terms of data relative to the business we are doing with all kinds of carriers with things that our reinsurance people are seeing can help our retailers and they are melding. So the business is strong. We are absolutely nailing it when it comes to what we hope the performer would be and I think itâ€™s going to continue to be a great business for us.Gallagher: Thanks Elyse.Gallagher: Hi David.Gallagher: Great.Gallagher: Well let me go around the world again as I did in my prepared remarks. So if you take a look at what we are seeing in Canada. And itâ€™s â€“ our team in terms of new business is on fire. When we closed on Neuraxis years ago and the Canadian economy was a little flush where it was a little slow. We werenâ€™t together. Neuraxis has seven separate businesses kind of operating separately. Now that business is totally together. The Gallagher branding is working extremely well. People are pumped up. We are using sales force. Our pipeline has grown and the 10% organic yes itâ€™s helped by rate but new business is much better than itâ€™s ever been. When you go to the UK that same timeframe we have added new â€“ recall we bought Heath Lambert Giles etcetera again a lot of time on integration. Today we will do an acquisition of size in the UK. And frankly we have got that thing integrated in five months to seven months. And they are putting on a Gallagher jersey. They are excited about it. Then our team just gets stronger and stronger there. Now I canâ€™t tell you that economic events arenâ€™t going to impact us. Recessions are terrible. Bad for our clients they are bad for us and they are bad for our business. But I would tell you that where we are from a team perspective is fantastic. So you are right to look through the numbers and say it seems like international is doing really well because as we walked around the world and told you the organic they are just killing it everywhere. Latin America is strong. New Zealand is strong. Australia is strong and all of that is not just rate driven. Thatâ€™s the thing I want to make sure everybody realizes is that itâ€™s not just because rates are moving we are getting our fair share of our new business opportunities. And in fact we are seeing hit ratios improve and we are being helped by our clientsâ€™ business expansions and just blocking and tackling. So itâ€™s a very good spot to be.Gallagher: David I think itâ€™s fair to say too what we have done in the United States in terms of the things you have seen in your SmartMarket Gallagher Drive. Those things are impacting our new business with carriers our retention and clearly our new business hit ratios using SmartMarket and we are taking those internationally now. So that was born and bred here in the U.S. But those are our products that are going to be available in Canada and the UK to start. And they are difference makers. And really remember when we compete and this is one of the things about again kind of being in a lucky spot. 90% of the time when our people go out the door to compete we are competing with somebody smaller. Say at 10% 11% 12% of the time we are competing with folks that frankly can come to the table with the same type of resources or story. But every other time when I talk to our sales force I think we should win. We donâ€™t obviously but I think thatâ€™s having an impact. Our people go out the door thinking they are going to win I will tell you that.Gallagher: Thanks David.Gallagher: They are going to overdo that. Thatâ€™s not â€“ my prediction is it will not.Gallagher: Correct.Gallagher: Well I got to understand the question. I mean our reinsurance clients pay us very very very well and very fairly and now a stable environment is not going to give us the ability to charge our clients. Does it give us the ability to invest more favorably absolutely because you now have people and our old business is people. To be perfectly blunt there were people who were going to join them before like join them in the middle of a sale. Nobody knows â€“ by the way remember I am not making this up it was public. I mean they couldnâ€™t tell the people at Willis where they are going to sit who are they going to work for. Thatâ€™s not easy to recruit into is it. Well there is lots of opportunities to invest. There is lots of â€“ at the same time reinsurance buyers are kind of frozen in the headlights. We want to see competition in the market. We donâ€™t want Willis frankly to disappear but we are not going to build the problem bigger. So yes there is opportunities for us to go back to those clients and say â€œHey we think we have got something to tell you now.â€ So I think once it settles down and we all get â€“ again I am four months into the quarter five months in total a year from now I will have a much better feel for the individuals.Gallagher: Thanks Meyer.Gallagher: The numbers we were talking about in the pipeline in our prepared remarks are totally outside of Willis Re. Willis Re is done those areâ€¦Gallagher: No. Our retail operations have zero distraction by the Willis Re folks.Gallagher: Thanks Weston. Darryl I think thatâ€™s all our questions for tonight. So I would like to just say thank you again for joining us. Obviously we had a fantastic start to 2022. I would like to thank our colleagues around the globe for their hard work. We are a people business and our results directly reflect your efforts. Thank you. We look forward to speaking with you again at our June Investor Day and thanks for being with us everybody.,0.002929717,0.003686845,0.000486621
154,154,D,Blue:,You got it.Yes Jeremy I'll start and Diane could add any color if necessary. But if you look our CE2 Clean Energy II filing that was just approved was slightly higher prices than our Clean Energy I filing that had been approved a year before. And we'll file again for our third round later this year. And that was approved. The commission looked at the cost inputs associated with that and approved that filing. So we're not -- we have not had specific conversations with the commission about this but we'll -- we file the next round of solar it will be on a similar kind of scale as what we filed before. And to the extent that there are some additional cost pressures we'll show why they're there. I do think it's important to understand that we've got a statute in Virginia the Clean Economy Act that calls for us to file for solar every year and hit those targets that are set out in the statute. And I think there's an understanding by all the parties there. And we still see solar as a very good value for our customers as we think about the overall clean energy transition. So we'll do the next filing. We're obviously well underway with working through the pieces of that. We'll have that filing done later this year but we're still very much on track.Yes. Certainly things that we look at. Obviously we have a grid transformation program underway. That'll be a decade long. Strategic undergrounding is an important part of that being able to sectionalize lines more quickly and isolate faults and restore service without as much human intervention will be part of it. Some of the just basics of bigger poles stronger conductor will also help. So yes we've got programs underway that we will continue and always look for ways that we can cost effectively strengthen our system for customers.,0.004443347,0.004443347,0
155,155,MCHP,Moorthy:,So Harlan first on the the unsupported backlog. Exiting June that unsupportive backlog was higher than what it was both what they said in our conference call as well as where it was at the end of March. The demand increase in the June quarter outpaced the supply improvements we could make. And hence we expect as we go in through September every indication we have is that the percentage of unsupported exiting September will be higher than where it was at the end of June. So that trend continues. We are not seeing demand and supply starting to converge or get into any kind of balance itself. Was there a second part of the question?So as we said all end markets were strong as we went through the June quarter. Some have been strong in prior quarters as well. We donâ€™t track end markets on a quarter-to-quarter by end market basis on it. But anecdotally some of what youâ€™re saying is correct. And we do see strengthened data centers in the second half of the year. And I donâ€™t recall what the year-over-year comparisons were on them. But right now there is no market that is feeling weak.So with respect to LTAs right we have a range of how we have those agreements I donâ€™t believe any of them have been big enough to be in our queues. So youâ€™re not going to see something there. That we have a long set of partners both on the front and the back end weâ€™ve worked with them quite constructively at this point in time. So thatâ€™s where we are on at in terms of our capacity for 2022 and beyond and what we need to do to secure it. On the NCNR agreements themselves those are thereâ€™s a legal agreement thatâ€™s a purchase agreement that we enter into which have obligations on our side obligations on the customer side. And weâ€™ve had these this is not new. Weâ€™ve done this for many many years on a smaller subset of our business and we have not found problems and enforcing the NCNR portions of our purchase contracts.Okay. Well Iâ€™ll start and Steven going to ask and can add on to this if they want. So we donâ€™t have a stated target for our net debt to EBITDA. But weâ€™ve made it very clear that weâ€™re focused on achieving an investment grade rating. And believe that thatâ€™s something that we can achieve in this fiscal year independent decision obviously by the rating agencies but weâ€™re making good progress on that. And even once we get there you shouldnâ€™t assume that we stopped paying down debt we will continue to pay down debt but weâ€™ll have more flexibility to increase dividends more or have a stock buyback program and youâ€™ll flex that as itâ€™s appropriate for our business. So Steve what would you like to add to that?Iâ€™d just add to that but we have made significant increases in our dividend in the last three quarters and itâ€™s up 18.8% year-over-year with the three large sequential increases that weâ€™ve made. So weâ€™re definitely heading in the right direction from a capital return standpoint but the next step is investment grade and then weâ€™ll take it from there.I donâ€™t think this one resembles any prior cycle. And to some extent many of these extraordinary cycles are all unique in and of themselves at the question of what precipitated them and what is happening. So this is a cycle unlike one we have seen before for many reasons. We constantly look at a set of internal indicators to look ahead and peek around the corner to see when is something possibly changing. They run the gamut of bookings billings sell-through the rate at which customers are able to have confidence in what theyâ€™re placing with us in backlog. Our anecdotal conversations with the executives of many of our customers of our channel partners. So itâ€™s a process of many many points of data that we as a team meet on a weekly basis and compare notes and see what we see in terms of what does the data tell us? And historically weâ€™ve been able to see things early. I hope we will do the same this time too. At this point there is no indication of any early warnings.So China is part of our reporting for Asia. In fact itâ€™s a substantial portion of our Asia revenue. I think itâ€™s about two thirds or so of that revenue. We reported that that geography grew 11% last quarter a little over 11% it is performing as we expect it remains strong. So there are no China demand issues that are visible and then what we see. With respect to automotive we are continuing to increase the shipments to automotive. We are shipping well above where we were pre-pandemic but the automotive demand also is quite substantially higher. It is a matter of they have many many companies that supply product to build a car and so you do hear about factories shutting down and customers not able to build what they want. And we are providing the products that we can provide at a rate that is consistent with our manufacturing. But weâ€™re still short to what automotive would like to buy for their growth and for their growth plans.There were an extraordinary set of circumstances that got us to where we are. The pandemic was one part of that the trade and tariff issues the year before that was another part of that. And then make not only create a demand side â€“ sorry supply side issues but created a lot of money that consumers had and they wanted to spend it and they spent it on things that required electronics for it they required things to work out of the home. So I think there are all kinds of factors that came into where we are. And of course many customers in uncertainty in the pandemic took their demand down and then realize that theyâ€™re taking it down too far. I donâ€™t know what the future brings. Clearly many of our customers are thinking through how should they â€“ from an inventory standpoint be preparing themselves so that they are able to run more stable through the cycles et cetera and where they go. I think there is a continued strong demand where people are building and selling through what theyâ€™re doing. I donâ€™t know what the shape of the next cycle would be. And more importantly what would be the causes of the next cycle? And I think to a large extent those will determine what the responses will be. And I certainly donâ€™t think government help is going to be the answer to any of these cycles. And from usually when a government begins to think of something the cycle is long passed before they can even act with respect to that. So I am very confident that the industry through many many many cycles has figured out how to make adjustments and how to build in such a way that is consistent with where the market is at. And they will do the same in this cycle. I donâ€™t know Steve youâ€™ve got longer years on this than I do?Sure. So the price increases largely have a template to pass on cost increases that weâ€™ve had. And we continue to get cost increases on a pretty regular basis in the current environment depending on what the material or the product that we need to buy and as they come along we donâ€™t do it all instantaneously. We will batch it and figure it out points at which we will do the increase in prices to go with it. And so thatâ€™s a continuous process and as and when it is needed in terms of us collecting the data. And at this point in time thereâ€™s nothing in our pricing thought process that would be different from what I said three months ago. If there is a need if there are costs increases that we cannot absorb. We patch it at some point in time and we pass along the price increase.The area we have the most. And the where we have been investing for multiple quarters is in our internal factories. So we expect that there will be more help coming where we have more control which is in our fabs our assembly and test factories et cetera. It doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™re not getting anything from our partners we are itâ€™s selective itâ€™s really depends on the situation and where weâ€™re getting. But it is correct that more help is coming from the factories we control them from our foundry and assembly test partners.Okay. So on the pricing front right I mean I think there is no insight into which way input costs are growing. At this point in time every indication is that input costs are going up in 2022. And weâ€™re already starting to hear of input costs going up in 2023. If and when there is a change in the trajectory of input costs we will relook at it at that point in time and so nothing to really say about input costs changing directions at this point in time. In regards to Silicon carbide it is a program that is important has focused and we have been bringing out products on a pretty consistent basis there and is an important part of our growth strategy is to capitalize on the markets which have both industrial and automotive components with industrialized realizing revenues sooner. By bringing the benefits of silicon carbide to those markets they go nicely hand in hand with many of our microcontrollers that play into these power conversion opportunities which is where silicon carbide plays. So yes itâ€™s we havenâ€™t made a big deal of it. But it is an important product line and important initiative for growth for us.So first of all I think in the â€“ from an industry perspective itâ€™s just the rate of growth that foundries seeing on these lagging edge technologies is so far ahead of any normal planning that they have done. That â€“ itâ€™s overwhelming what the capacity available is? Well the normal reaction you would say is well why arenâ€™t they building more? Well the economics of that for the foundries and the opportunity cost versus other capital objectives that they have donâ€™t always lend themselves to saying that trailing edge capacity is where they want to be invested. Itâ€™s not that theyâ€™re making no investments they are but theyâ€™re not fast enough. And theyâ€™re not at a rate for products that we consider to be important for us. Now weâ€™re not doing it across the board weâ€™re just picking and choosing places where we think there is significant constraint for us our opportunity for us to make that investment. And that is true not only in the fab thatâ€™s true in assembly and test as well as to why weâ€™re doing it. And what weâ€™re seeing. It will mean that we will continue to use all of the capacity available from our foundry and assembly test partners. Plus we will try to make sure that we have where we can additional capacity to be able to not be constrained by what is available only from our outside partners itself. In terms of the CapEx itself I mean youâ€™ve seen â€“ if you go back and look at our history last 5 10 years youâ€™ll find that we have gone above and below that 3% to 5% â€“ 3% to 4% number I think the two years previous to this we were at about 1%. And thatâ€™s where the cycle was thatâ€™s what we needed in that. So I think a three year look gives you a better sense. And we could spend more than 3% to 4% in any given year as we look at investing at a time when that need is there and then weâ€™ll breathe with that capacity and let it all build out over that time. But at this point in time thatâ€™s what we feel comfortable with. If that changes in time weâ€™ll keep you posted. But all this capital that weâ€™re investing all the capacities weâ€™re bringing on all of it we think will be accretive to our gross margins and will enabled growth that we would otherwise not have had if our only choice was to take it outside.We donâ€™t drive distribution to what inventory they should carry. The numbers we report are what their decisions are both in terms of what they see as a demand but in this â€“ in the current condition what they see as the supply available to them. PSP customers are coming to us as much from distribution as well. So I would not take PSP and say itâ€™s direct customers; only many many customers who are distribution customers are placing PSP orders on it. The issue is that when demand so far exceeds supply you cannot build inventory internally or in the channel at that point in time. So until we get to the point where we can help provide more product than theyâ€™re shipping out. Distribution inventory is not likely to go up.No there are scenarios in which a 12-inch fab may make sense for us. But thereâ€™s nothing really to talk about at this point in time.So firstly taking our own internal factories right. So many of the protocols that we implemented last year to operate safely to have backup plans if people need to be inside of the factory and all that is normal part of our contingency planning. In addition we have taken steps to accelerate how vaccines can be brought in and deployed. So for example over the course of last week and this week a substantial portion of our Thailand factory is going to be fully vaccinated. Weâ€™re taking steps to get preventative things we can do. Weâ€™re trying to do the same thing in the Philippines and then we have some some challenges to overcome to get there. Weâ€™re working with our factory partners. And from where theyâ€™re operating there are challenges. So far nothing is really a major enough issue for us to result in significant loss in production. So as that data unrolled and as we see what the rules and regulations are we will manage around it. And as best as we can we have contingency plans. But I know itâ€™s â€“ thereâ€™s no answer which says we have all scenarios thought through so far no major issues. And weâ€™re okay with where things are at but being prudent on where things might go.I want to thank everybody for attending the call today. We have several investor events coming up over the next month month and a half of timeframe. And we look forward to talking to many of you at that point in time. So thank you.,0.002860802,0.003360629,0.00022924
156,156,AEP,Akins:,Yes. I don't see a lot of risk and the reason why is because ours is more 2030 a lot of these projects will come into play in the 2024 2025 timeframe. So we have time for not only for the reviews of solar that's occurring with the administration but also in terms of the supply chain activities just to level out somewhat before we're actually out back in the market acquiring these types of resources. So we have a little bit of time I think probably by first quarter next year we want to see things start to levelize so that we can get that process rolling. In the meantime we got the resource planning filings that are being made. And keep in mind too I made this point originally. These plans are really fungible from year to year based upon what we see in terms of the value proposition of each type of resources. So a lot of its wind some of it's solar solar picks up in the later years from a resource plan perspective so there is time for the solar thing to get resolved. But even if it doesn't that sales is probably going to be more wind or other types of resources that are put in place to support these objectives because remember they're driven by capacity requirements and we'll continue to evaluate that process. And I'll take a step further too on this is we've always said that if something were they happen relative to the renewables build out we've got transmission and transmission we can soak up a lot of capital from that perspective because of the focus on providing better customer service more resilient and reliable grid. So we have that optionality but I'm not I'm not even there yet. I think we're - we may be because the $8.2 billion we have in there assumes a certain percentage of those types of resources that we would own. That could be higher transmission could be higher. So we have optionality around all of that. So I'm not concerned from an AEP perspective.Absolutely absolutely because the $3 billion for North Central was down on our previous gas forecast and if you look at that today it's probably much larger. I think it's really looking good for customers.Yes so - and the point I'm making is obviously we're going through the process step by step with the unregulated contracted renewables parts so there is different parts of that business. And then of course just - I think Kentucky was the first shot at it. There is a lot of optimization that can occur. We'll just have to evaluate against what the opportunities look like. And if we're - if we have I mean if we have underperforming utilities that don't figure prominently into the into the clean energy transformation where we're actually attracting capital and being able to provide higher levels of return then we have to look at it so. So I'm just saying that that process will continue regardless not saying and actually we're already too deep and I've talked about the number too deep. In terms of sales Kentucky we still have to get across and then the contracted renewables we still get across. And then we'll see where we're at that point based upon what we're getting in terms of the feedback of the RFPs because when these RFPs are ultimately get approved they will know exactly what the ownership looks like what the financial requirements are and we'll do what we've always done. We'll make sure that we're going through this process making to invest in the right places and we will look at the portfolio and see what makes sense and what doesn't make sense for us to continue to optimize that for shareholder benefit.It's typical to have those kinds of provisions in that kind of agreement but I can tell you that we and Algonquin are arm-in-arm getting this thing across the finish line. They very much want to own this property and they've actually - they've actually stepped up in a considerable way to provide customer benefits to make this transaction attractive to the policymakers and to the customers. So and of course - I think a seminal event here obviously is May 4th where the commission will come out with an order and we will look at that order we will make determinations on what conditions are in place and at that point in time we'll make decisions on what it looks like. But I think from the public interest standpoint the things that the commission also be looking at this transaction is very very good for Kentucky customers and if there are - I think everyone has to be sort of level headed about all of this because when you get through this process you actually have a - you have a timeframe now for customer benefits to occur substantial benefits and that's really a driver to get this thing done as quickly as possible particularly in this energy related environment. So I really don't anticipate that happening but if it did we'll do what we always do we'll figure out what the options are and what the possibilities are and go from there. But right now we're not planning on that.Well typically and we've done this we actually plan for around 130% of the budget for transmission. So we have 30% more projects that are occurring that we already have planned scoped ready to go. So layering in these multiple projects is a way for us to not only as opportunities arrive as the metrics for financials continue to improve we can layer in more of that we can adjust to that based on projects that go one way or another. And then also recently we were awarded in Texas - a large project in Texas that's also incremental. So it was like $1.3 billion or so but that - those are the kinds of things that will come to pass and we have every bit of opportunity related to transmission not only within our own system but also in terms of the incremental systems around us and that's why - and you asked about FERC and transmission FERC obviously is taking the right steps relative to long-term planning getting the framework for long-term planning put in place. That's an important part of the process to speed up some of the planning aspects to ensure that we are making the right investments at the right places. We continue and I think FERC will continue to look at even in parallel these issues of cost allocation of even the incentive mechanism but also in terms of - and the regional planning which AEP will bode well in terms of that because just about everyone interfaces with us. So as you look at some of these aspects the more renewables that are needed certainly the more retirements that are occurring across RTOs is all going to bode well for transmission investment. And we - what we see today is not we're going to see tomorrow. And then if FERC is doing the right thing which we think they are is going to bolster the ability for us to have a more consistent congruent clean-energy type system across this nation and you can't do that without AEP.No that will likely come after shortly thereafter and the way we've looked at it is that obviously you want the transfer agreement done. But as far as the Mitchell agreement approval we expect that to occur shortly thereafter with both commissions because it's an important aspect of it and something I think that really helps for the transaction side as well.That's right that's right.Yes sure.Yes it's great question because you're right two quarters doesn't it doesn't make a trend. But when you look at the economy within our service territory we're seeing some very positive indicators for continued expansion and continued economic development. We are - our economic development people are extremely busy with multiple opportunities that are coming throughout our territory actually. And so we look at that we look at the sort of - if you were to look at our pipeline of potential opportunities it is extremely robust and that gives us confidence in terms of where we think the economy is going to continue to go within our service territory. And of course we don't see an end to the work from home environment. So we're feeling much better about the prospects of a more robust residential side of things. And then on the industrial like I said the onshoring the security aspects the energy play within our service territory. The other aspects of what's going on within the territory with chemicals manufacturing and so forth that pace has picked up markedly with expansions and new developments and some of them are still years away like the NTL manufacturing here in Ohio in our territory. It's substantial there'll be 20 to 40 more companies associated with that. It will be locating. So you see those types of prerequisites that are being put in place that gives us a lot of positive views about where we think the economy is going. We'll watch it we'll continue to evaluate it. If we go to the third quarter see the same thing and fourth quarter the same thing then you'll probably see some adjusting going on relative to the 2023 forecast but that's - our load guy will have to tell us that he is very objective and he's is a professor at one of the universities and he - usually he is - let me put it this way he is probably more optimistic now than I've ever seen him and that's a good thing.Yes I think it will make it more complicated but not insurmountable because whatever increases you may see from a solar perspective the overall project benefits will still be part of it. Now it may change the relationship between wind and solar in the integrated resource plan. Solar may come later than what we thought because if wind continues to continues to progress as you go in our resource plan a lot of it was when to start and then eventually it's based on pricing and everything else solar would start to pick up and at some point overcome the wind asset and then you move into other technologies. That condition may change based on that but you also I mean you'll probably see that in the framework of increased gas prices too. So really the renewables will be relative to each other not in terms of relative to whether they'll get done or not. So and I really think we'll be in good shape from that perspective. The other part two is that when you look at the other resources really what you're doing is you're putting in renewables and you're also layering in some natural gas in the plan to really give it 24/7 supplier. Natural gas also is a placeholder for other types of resources whether it's hydrogen whether it's small modular reactors whatever that comes about with new technologies and the grid optimization itself will be a major part of that as well with transmission. So there is a multitude of answers there that will occur. But yes you're right you would suspect solar there'll be some short-term perturbation from an increase perspective that we'll have to deal with. But in the overall scheme of things when you look at long-term it will still be positive.Yes so at SWEPCO we have rate cases there in two of the jurisdictions and PSO we will have a rate case as well. And but keep in mind too we just brought in all of the renewables in play particularly a large chunk of it for PSO and SWEPCO. So that's now rolling through rates and so we expect that to continue to pick up those are - and really when you look at the industrial and manufacturing economic development part of what's going on in those jurisdictions they are still very positive. So and of course we continue to invest heavily in those jurisdiction so and that's why we have equalizer chart that some of the peer lower until we file rate cases and when the investment changes itself so we're not concerned by that at this point and actually we see PSO and the SWEPCO jurisdictions with Arkansas Louisiana in particular very favorable.The true up was positive the previous year and yes sort of double count.Sure thing. Thanks Michael.,0.002723763,0.002941012,0.000139944
157,157,WDAY,Sisco:,Yes. So part of our flattish operating cash flow this year is due to the margin contraction that we expect to happen throughout the year. So that will become a headwind on cash flow growth year-over-year. We've done really well on cash. And certainly I see some upside to our guide but our biggest cash flow month is January in fact the last 2 weeks of January where we have a very significant amount of annual invoices come due. And so we need to just take a wait-and-see attitude as we go through the year. But I certainly see some upside from our guide of $1.2 billion.Yes. There's actually several things in there Mark. So as you know 1% of our revenue -- our margin raise was tied to the increase in our revenue guidance raise as well. And then as I mentioned earlier we have really ambitious investment plans. And we have strong confidence that we can reach our hiring goals for the year but the timing of that hiring is going to cause some potential variability into the margins throughout the year. And the last thing I'll mention is as you said we still are getting some COVID-related benefits in our expenses this year particularly from travel as well as office-related expenses and the lull in the hiring we saw last year. So we expect that savings to significantly moderate as we get into the back half of the year.Yes. Scott so we were very pleased with the renewals in Q1 with gross retention once again over 95%. At the end over the past year we saw some impacts from increased bankruptcies in the medium enterprise space as well as an increase in customers lowering worker counts even as some other customers actually continued to increase worker counts. So as we approached this year we assumed we'd see some improvements in the bankruptcies and workers trends and we are really pleased to see overperformance in Q1 on this front. So we're off to a really good start and expect strong renewals to continue through the year.,0.010558605,0.010558605,0
158,158,TDG,Stein:,Good morning.We don't have that split out by different segments in our bookings. It's too difficult to see that. We just look at ourselves as market weighted. And as wide-bodies start to fly more and are utilized more certainly will have to up gauge our manufacturing there but I don't think we see it as a concern for us right now.Sure. We always look at all uses of cash. And I think we've always communicated that -- the first and primary use is to invest in our own businesses. Secondarily is M&A next comes capital allocation back out to our shareholders. And then the last priority would be paying down debt. I don't think the debt environments have changed enough for us to modify our strategy. It may happen one day but it's certainly not yet.Absolutely.Well on the margin side we don't want to give quarterly guidance. We're not there yet. So I don't want to give margin guidance on a per quarter basis. I don't see anything out there that concerns me about Q2 and as we go forward. We just aren't issuing guidance and we had a very strong Q1. So it's just the normal conservatism in our commentary.Yeah. I think that's what we would have to get to. So the math will share what -- given the slow start. This will be more of a of a stretch for us for the year but we still feel confident enough to leave it there. As the business generally recovers as Cobham starts to grow I think this will rectify itself.Good morning.Yeah. It is a lot of art and not science on that. So we do look as we go forward of if we pay a dividend today how could we finance anything that we see coming along on the horizon? Or sometimes there are surprise acquisitions that come up how could you deal with them. So there's always a bit of art and looking at what's happening as we go forward. Given that we're starting to recover in the commercial markets and we're starting to see more commercial opportunities. It may be that we want to be a little more thoughtful about paying out a huge dividend today and looking at the opportunities that are coming. This is all in our thought process right now as we're evaluating what we should do over the next 12 months to get this excess cash out as I said some combination of M&A share buybacks and dividends will be utilized as we always have. You can go back and look at our previous history we did buybacks. We've always -- we've been very engaged in dividends. We do a lot of M&A transactions. So nothing has changed. The market is very volatile right now. There's a lot happening.It's really a lack of willingness to sell. It's a lack of opportunities of properties that you are interested in. There is -- yeah there's not a lot of them when the commercial market is so depressed. People would not be able to sell at the same price they could have before COVID. So they're trying to see that things get back to that space. As far as paying up on transactions I never like to speculate. I think if things match our criteria if a business matches our criteria we would look very strongly at it. And so for us it is staying disciplined in our M&A process. M&A models are the same. We are looking at businesses the same way as always.Good morning.Yeah. I think it's probably an artifact of doing business with the U.S. government the DoD. There are many audits that happen constantly amongst defense contractors and suppliers to the government of all kinds. I think this is part of the nature of doing business and we have to get used to it. I think that the work that Jorge has done with the working groups with the DLA DoD will certainly help this. It's a communication gap I think. And we will continue to work this issue and improve it I think as we go forward.Good morning.Yeah. I think we're not as worried. If upside comes remember aftermarket is more -- is less labor dependent than is the OEM side. I think the bell curve is pretty wide in expectations. We're just trying to guide to what are some of the possibilities so that people can plan accordingly. For us to be successful in this environment we must be nimble. We must react quickly and that's what we're good at. So I think the 20% to 30% planning is appropriate. It was difficult for us to think that we would have to plan for something larger than that at the time that seems like a huge growth from where we were with what we knew. I think in general we're less worried about the aftermarket curve ramp-up than we are about the OEM side. It's why it's difficult again for us to give guidance without that OEM knowledge plan.Defense business is generally lower profitability. So it all goes with the mix. We make less money on defense. We make less money on the OEM side at the aftermarket where we make our dollars on commercial aftermarket. So all of these things lead to the stronger margin performance in the quarter.Yeah. I think we're not guiding on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We're looking at it for the year and we're comfortable with low-single digits in defense and we'll see how it plays out.Yeah I can't comment on this quarter. We're just into it. I think you can look at last quarter and see the improvement in OEM bookings and aftermarket bookings. The fact that we're booking more than we're shipping and our shipments are up 49% in the aftermarket. These are all encouraging signs to momentum building.Good morning.Yeah. In general we saw a little bit of an increase in inflation in Q1 primarily on electronic components. Not so much on labor although we would anticipate obviously given the macro indications that labor will feel that inflationary pressure throughout the year. In general our goal with pricing is to institute price increases above inflation so real price increases. That philosophy has not changed in this environment. Ultimately with the higher inflation we've got to pass on some of that to the customer base and that's done at the operating unit level and the teams are doing their best job to get in front of that knowing that the inflationary pressures will likely continue to increase throughout the balance of the year.Yeah. I don't have the specific monthly data. Really we look at it across the quarter. The aftermarket recovery can be lumpy in nature as well and we saw good sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter.,0.002914488,0.003044963,0.000184013
159,159,PSX,Lashier:,Yeah. Thanks Ryan. I think that your closing comment really touched on it that since the last call with crude moving up and ethane to a crude advantage becoming enhanced thatâ€™s driven margins wider for CPChem and the entire industry and we are well-positioned to take advantage of ethane both here in the U.S. and in the Middle East. So thatâ€™s there and I think that thatâ€™s going to persist. You are going to see the ethane extraction value driven to a point to attract more ethane out as more consumption comes online. That consumption is going to provide a headwind in new capacity as we go into seasonally stronger margins. So you kind of see those two things balancing off each other. So we see kind of a status quo in those margins going forward into the next quarter.Thanks.As far as other opportunities we are doing things at our Humber Refinery today. The rules are a little different in the U.K. than they are in the U.S. so they can co-process renewable feedstocks through their facility and they are producing sustainable aviation fuel today that they are supplying to British Airways. And so there are British Airways planes flying today using sustainable aviation fuel from Humber. We can also -- if the economics drive it we can produce sustainable aviation fuel at Rodeo when we have the facility fully on stream and so itâ€™s going to be what are the economic drivers? We are looking at other opportunities other technical routes to sustainable aviation fuel. They are still under development. But ultimately we think that sustainable aviation fuel has legs. Itâ€™s difficult to fly planes with things other than hydrocarbons. And we have had a number of airlines a number of jet manufacturers approach us helping to look for solutions for their future. So we see both renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel as great opportunities.Thanks.Yeah. I think that in that universe thereâ€™s -- the contractual commitments are a little [Audio Gap] bit fuzzier than you might be used to in other environments. So I donâ€™t know that thereâ€™s -- that they are seeing any margin capture do that. CPChemâ€™s margins contracted substantially less than the IHS marker. And I think that that has to do with product mix more than anything. The high density business that is their primary driver. It came up a little slower than the marker and now itâ€™s coming off slower than the market. And so itâ€™s really driven by that and perhaps some discipline in how they are managing the business. But I donâ€™t know that thereâ€™s a great driver in their contractual position that you can attribute that to.That is in addition to the alliance shutdown.CPChem really is a technically a producer of hydrogen out of the large steam crackers. They have got relationships often that allow them to monetize that. It has to be cleaned up. But -- or some of it is consumed as fuel in the facility. So there probably is an opportunity for CPChem to grow that presence as they grow their cracking capabilities.I will take a shot at the turnaround again. As we talked we are finishing up the turnaround program that we had for the first half and we have guided towards a total of about $340 million of spend in the first part of this year. During the summer or during gasoline season right we are prepared to run hard and so we wonâ€™t have any turnarounds again until the fall. We continue to look at all of our turnarounds that are in the back half of the year catalyst life and can we push those out. We expect to push some of those turnarounds out. We are not ready to update the budget. But I think you can expect that we will spend less money on turnarounds than we originally guided to as we are able to slide some of those out of the back half of 2022 into 2023.Yeah. Thanks guys. Itâ€™s a great question. CPChemâ€™s got a long history of executing mega projects and have really never tried to time them to any particular market conditions. They focus on the fundamentals. The long-term growth in ethylene demand the long-term growth in polyethylene demand both at a multiple of GDP as we go forward. And so thatâ€™s what drives the opportunities. And then we think about that growth we put those assets where we can access low cost feedstocks. And today and for the foreseeable future we see that as ethane. Thatâ€™s why you see us doing something in the U.S. around our U.S. Gulf Coast two project. Thatâ€™s why you see us looking at another project in Qatar to take advantage of large baseload infrastructure and advantaged feedstocks that we can tap into. And I think thatâ€™s what delivers the long-term value staying focused on those fundamentals and not getting caught up in any short-term dislocations and then having an outstanding ability to take those products into the marketplace and capture value consistently around the planet.,0.003255248,0.003992081,0.00052109
160,160,VLO,Gorder:,So Manav I'll just say that -- I said it earlier we live one day at a time. And we certainly like your thinking and your mindset. And frankly I think everything you've heard from the team this morning is that things look constructive on all segments of our business right now. And so we're optimistic but we don't cut our chickens before they're hatched. So we'll continue to do what we do and that is coming every day and try to operate safely and reliably in an environmentally responsible way and to optimize to the extent we can. And if we just keep doing that day after day after day I think we're going to find ourselves in a really good place.Well Martin do you want to?Manav the one thing that I would say too and we don't talk about it a lot but our team's ability to execute major projects like this. I mean Lane has really worked very hard on this over the years and our team's ability to execute significant projects and the partners that we've got helping execute those prospects are extraordinary. And at least to the kind of results that you said look like a trend and it's a trend that we like and we'll try to maintain.So you're saying if we have a year -- in a lean year for growth CapEx you're talking about a year where we spend less on growth CapEx?No. Got you.Yes. I mean Sam I think it was mentioned earlier Jason mentioned earlier we haven't yet achieved the three targets that we're shooting for as far as the use of cash whether it be the debt ratio buybacks and so on. So we've got a little bit of work to do around that yet but building a little bit of cash that never is very troubling to us.Well I mean if we ended up in a huge recession I think those are the kind of things that certainly are out of our control but it would likely affect demand. And another bout of COVID that would shut down people's mobility would impact us. But outside noncontrollable factors like that right now I mean I just -- I think we're generally pretty bullish about the way things look. You add anything?Yes.Well I mean probably the safest way for us to talk about that is from our own perspective. And there haven't been assets in the market that were compelling for us to buy. That doesn't mean there aren't attractive assets that we'd be interested in. But with our experience in acquisitions of assets you go through the periods of being super enthusiastic about it and then you get deal heat you want to go do it and then you buy it and then you get in there and you start looking at it and Lane tells me it's going to cost $3 billion to get it up to a Valero standard and I look at it maybe that wasn't exactly the best thing. So for us truly it is simply a matter of asset allocation Ryan. I mean where do we want to spend our money. And right now it's not that these assets aren't good or aren't attractive. It's just we feel we've got higher return better uses for the capital we want to employ than buy on a refinery that's on the market at this point in time. So I'll stop there. Anything you would add you guys.I wouldn't say that by any stretch. I mean we -- you know our MO right? We talk about stuff after we fully developed it understand how much it's going to cost and have a good feel for the market. And so I think it's fair for you to assume that Lane and the team are looking at all the projects and we evaluate them against each other. I wouldn't want to tell you that there'll never be another refining project but I can tell you a lot of the stuff that's in the hopper that he and the team are looking at tend to be more towards the cleaner fuel side. But honestly I would never say never on another great project.,0.002783328,0.002834618,5.13E-05
161,161,TT,Regnery:,Hey Andy. How are you?Yes. It's a good question. Not 300 but order rates remained strong in the first quarter up 6%. And that was a bit of a surprise to us considering we were up 40% the prior year. So the demand continues to be strong. Our independent sell-through was strong. The inventory in the channel is about where we expect it to be. In the first quarter we had growth in the new construction channel although it's a smaller portion of our business. We'll watch interest rates there and see what happens. But to use your words we don't see it falling off a cliff the replacement cycle. Again resi is about 20% of our business. So even if the replacement cycle did drop 10% which we don't see it happening it would be about a 2% drop for the enterprise. And the amount of opportunities that we are seeing in the decarbonization opportunities in both our commercial HVAC business and our Thermo King business on a global basis will far exceed that.Yes. Really our business operating system is really being leveraged across the enterprise right now. We see what's coming around the corner and the teams are being very proactive. Andy you also asked a question about mix. Yes mix helped us a bit in the quarter. We are seeing mix up. And that really -- that's a good news story because that's where a lot of our innovation is.Thanks Andy. Have a good day.Hi Julian.Yeah. Let me start and then I'll ask Chris to comment a little bit on the pricing side. As far as the volume is concerned what we saw in the first quarter it's not -- it's a demand -- our demand is constrained by supply. Okay? So with our backlog if we had unconstrained supply right now we'd be shipping much more and we'd be invoicing much more. So in the first quarter we opportunistically bought some for lack of better explanation chipsets on the open market and spot buys which we think is a good investment for retaining our customers. So we wanted to take care and we saw an opportunity and we executed on it. And we saw more volume come through in the first quarter as a result of that. Now can that continue through the rest of the year? Supply chain as we said in the fourth quarter is going to be choppy through the first half of the year. We have more confidence in the back half of the year. Working with our suppliers closely understanding their constraints understanding their commitments to us. Also some help -- self-help redesigns that we have coming online in the third quarter. So that gives us confidence in the back half of the year. I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about pricing?Thanks Julian.Hey Josh.Good morning.Yes I don't have the direct split yet on the repair -- retrofit versus new. But I would tell you that it was strong across all verticals. Okay? Data centers electronics. And it really just speaks volumes to the innovations that we've been able to put into the market. And we have customers that were winning today because of the solutions that we're able to provide. And it's not just about the chiller. It's about the control system that goes with it. It's about the building controls. It's about being connected to the product. It's about being able to run AI algorithms against data that's in a data warehouse to improve the efficiency of buildings and data centers and hospitals. And it's all of that system of things that's just really -- we're in high gear here and you could see it by the order rates that we're taking in. So we're -- the team is really excited. I've never -- I was out in one of our sales offices a couple of weeks ago and I would tell you that the teams there have never been more pumped up about number one the innovation that we're providing them to go to talk to customers about and to win customers but just the whole -- the strength that they're seeing within the marketplace. So it's an exciting time right now. We're hopeful that the -- and we believe it will. The back half of the year from a supply constraint will get better. And we'll take some of this massive backlog that we have right now $6.2 billion of backlog. I never thought I would say that. $6.2 billion of backlog which 90% of it is on our commercial HVAC business. We'll start shipping it and we'll start taking care of customers.Thanks Josh..Hey Steve. Good morning.No problem.I thought -- Steve I thought you were going to thank me for delivering such a strong first quarter.Exactly. So services think about services as 50-50 right? 50% of our business is services. Our services were up double digits so low teens.Yes. I mean again if you -- the comps get tough right? Remember last year our order rates were up over 30% and virtually almost every quarter. So they get difficult. But I think you could be looking at -- if you look at a global basis think about commercial HVAC is probably a bit positive think about Thermo King again where there's different dynamics going in in that space where we're actually constraining some of the incoming order rates purposely just to manage inflationary risks that could be down a bit. So flattish maybe plus or minus 1% or 2% on a global basis. Chris?All right. Thanks.Hey Nigel how are you?Yeah. There's nothing like a big ESCO job that book. So these are -- this is just broad-based growth across many different verticals. And you think about what's happening with decarbonization think about what's happening in the education vertical think about what's happening with indoor air quality. In many verticals it's nice tailwinds. We've been saying that for a while and you're seeing it in our order books.Yeah. Longer than they normally will just because of our extended lead times. But nothing that I would say is extraordinary. It really is a supply constraint.If we had unlimited supply we'd be shipping a lot of product right now.Well I'm not very paranoid as a person so I won't use that term. But it really has to do with working with our suppliers. And it's just amazing open communication understanding what their constraints are understanding what our needs are. We have some of our what we're calling self-help redesigns. We're simplifying some of our designs to help our suppliers have more throughput to us whether it be with wire harnesses is a great example. And those are the kind of things that we've been executing on. A lot of those are going to come on in the back half of the year. So we've seen surprises before but we're pretty confident that the back half is going to be better than what we've seen here at least in the first half which remains choppy. And our team is just doing an excellent job to managing this day-to-day. And if they have a problem they triage it they overcome it. We have incredible processes that we've set up now. And we're getting really really sophisticated at executing when a problem does arise.Sure Nigel.Hey Andrew. How are you?Yeah. And Andrew I would just add that even with interest rates and I guess we'll find out at 2 oâ€™clock at least East Coast time today what the Fed decides to do. But they're still pretty low rates comparably to historical norms.No problem. As far as the SEER transition we don't see a big pre-buy. I think it really has to do with the way this year change is being executed with the south at least at the AC level it's an installed base. So it's not a manufacturing date the North is a manufacturing date. So think of it more as a phase in phase out of inventory that we'll see in the South. We're actually really good at this with all of our innovation. We're constantly doing phase in phase outs within our own plants. So we're taking those chapters out of our business operating system and helping our distributors manage their inventory in a proactive way. We don't see a big pre-buy and we're certainly more than ready for this transition to higher SEER products.No problem.Hey Deane. Good morning.Yeah. Specifically to Thermo King.No. I think it's more about explaining to the customer that we're trying to ensure that one we can price it properly. But they're probably also getting constrained on another â€“ from another OEM as well whether it be a trailer or a tractor. So we're trying to help them marry that demand up. So slotting in this industry is not new. And it's not only Thermal King. It's also trailer as well as tractors that we're seeing some of that happen. So we're working with our customers. They know â€“ these are â€“ we have some pretty loyal customers in our Thermo King business as you can imagine with the innovations that we have in our products. So we haven't seen customers move away from that. They understand the reason why and they're working with us as that dynamic continues to persist.,0.006408677,0.016493082,0.005844759
162,162,LULU,Frank:,Lorraine so in terms of gross margin we're guiding to 200 basis points of pressure in Q2 and then approximately 100 to 150 basis point decline for the full year. The second quarter does include 150 basis points of air freight pressure year-over-year. And then we also have increased our outlook for the year in terms of air freight pressure to 30 basis points. We previously had that as flat. When we look at just I would note the operating margin for the full year it's modestly under 2019 even inclusive of a 300 basis point impact from air freight pressure. So as you say I think we see that moderating over the long term and certainly the opportunity to recoup that. But at this point in time I think the supply chain pressures will be with us for the balance of 2022 and we'll continue to keep you updated and then obviously closely monitoring the environment and the team continues to balance those decisions as Calvin mentioned with our revenue momentum. Thank you.Hey Paul. So in terms of AUC if I put air freight aside we're seeing modest increases in raw material prices. So no material change in our underlying AUC and continue to closely monitor those impacts closely working with our suppliers and as we look into 2023. In terms of pricing we're taking modest price increases on about 10% of our assortment. As we said before we strategically look at prices in terms of quality and make of our goods and the competitive landscape and we'll continue to use that as a strategy as we move forward. In terms of occupancy I think overall -- our topline trend obviously very strong at the 27% three-year sales CAGR. And leveraging occupancy to a large degree given our outperformance on topline as well as the strength of our e-commerce business. We haven't broken out the leverage point but continue to see opportunity on that line item as we move throughout 2022.We haven't broken that out but can follow-up with some additional information.Michael I'll take the first part of that question. So in terms of air freight we are up against some increases last year as we move into the second half of the year. So expect the air freight impact to be a leverage point in Q4 when we look on a one-year basis. But I would say in terms of how we're looking at the future I think coming off of the full year air freight I think too early to say on 2023 how we see that moderating but do expect to have a leverage point. as we lap the high water line in Q4 of last year.Yeah. So I'd say there to date we've seen modest increases in terms of raw materials prices. And we have â€“ we have started taking some price increases in Q1 as I said modest and will be on less than 10% of our assortment. We haven't seen any price resistance to-date. And we'll continue to have a few actions as we roll throughout the year there. So we'll continue to look at that as a lever. I think when we look at our operating margin overall we are modestly for the year under 2019 even with that 300 basis point pressure of air freight. So feel as that environment moderates we should have some opportunity in front of us in terms of recouping the air freight pressure. And we continue to look across our business in terms of opportunities to deliver on our five-year average target of modest operating margin expansion obviously navigating those near-term challenges with air freight and ensuring importantly that we continue to drive the momentum in our business through key investments as well.Yes. So I think when we look at our inventory on a one-year basis the rate -- the growth rate includes air freight impacts and then also higher in transient with those longer ocean durations. And then also we're comparing to periods of being under inventory last year. So that would have been relevant for Q1 of 2021. And we feel the most relevant way to look at inventory as we navigate these supply chain disruptions and the comparisons to the pandemic period is to look at the three-year unit CAGR. And that is really consistent with how we're looking at planning our business. And so that 3-year unit CAGR for us at the end of Q1 was up 36% 5 points impact included in that for longer in-transit time. So adjusting for that 31% unit increase we think is well aligned with our top line momentum. So when we look at that 3-year revenue CAGR it's 27% in Q1 and then 26% in terms of our Q2 guide. And then I'd say still really pleased with full price momentum or markdowns in Q1 were relatively flat year-over-year still 40 basis points below 2019. So really looking at leveraging also the core and nonseasonal nature of our business which is about 45% of our assortment as well. We tend to have low markdowns overall and don't see a change to that posture as we move throughout the year.,0.002923528,0.003552616,0.000453665
163,163,BIIB,Singhal:,Thank you Michael. Yes I would say that across the board we are going to be driven by science and integration and maximizing the value that we bring to patients with diseases of high unmet need. So I think we would evaluate all options. But I think the science has to be the driver and that's how we would do the evaluations. So yes exactly as you said.Yes. Thank you Marc. It's a really pertinent question here. So I think two -- it's a 2-pronged approach. Number one we're going to be driven by the science we're going to stay within neuroscience. So I think at this point I want to be very clear that we stay within neuroscience. It's a very important part of our expertise our talent pool and we are continuing to build on our strengths there. But we are definitely open to adjacencies. We've already demonstrated -- for example as I mentioned with the zuranolone filing and with the 104 readout coming on its heels. In addition I think that we are working in lupus. So that's a specialized immunology field. And we may consider other indications we may consider other potential opportunities in the space. So that's one way in which we would diversify and rebalance our risk. Because as you know the probability of technical and regulatory success changes as you move out of neuroscience. But given our core expertise of neuroscience and all the learnings we've had we believe we have a lot of asymmetrical knowledge in the space. And in that space we are continuing to enhance our probability of success maximize it in fact by building on our strengths in biomarkers clinical development functional genomics human validation. So we believe that these are the methodologies which will help us sort of increase our probability of success and give us the ability to deliver on proof of concepts. So it's a two-pronged strategy. And add to that our four pillars which you already know about biosimilars and digital health. We're also looking at integration right with digital options. So this really goes beyond a very narrow focus. It looks at the portfolio in totality and the value that the portfolio brings in totality. And it's -- we have the expertise in terms of modalities. We have all modalities available to us. So we're looking at targets and we're looking at the best modality. We're not looking at modalities and how do we kind of exploit those. We're looking at it in the reverse way. We're looking at disease target and then what's the best modality to go forward with. I hope that gives you a bit of a glimpse of how we're approaching this. Thank you. Can I just address the last part? I meant to add that you asked about how we would do this in a Board setting in a management setting. I want to say that I have a lot of authority currently and I am making decisions on prioritization. So that I hope will go forward.Thank you. So I'll just step back Brian and say that accelerated approval pathway is a very very highly rigorous and scientific regulatory pathway. It's existed for several years now. And several products have come through the pathway and many patients around the United States have benefited from this access. So I know that there's a lot of dialogue and I'm reading the same as you are. But I don't believe that at any point right now there is going to be a potential major shift. There could be enhancements there could be sort of refinements. I'm sure that could happen to any regulatory pathway as more learnings are obtained. But I don't believe that our confidence has been shaken in the accelerated approval pathway. It remains a critical way in which you can bring products to patients who really need them today. So that's number one. Number two I'll say that with CLARITY AD the strategy has been -- and I think this has been publicly communicated by Eisai and us so I'm just quoting that that they have filed -- they've initiated the filing based on the Phase II study as you know. And that is via the Accelerated Approval Pathway. There is agreement from the FDA. And Eisai have commented on this publicly as well that CLARITY AD could serve as a confirmatory study. Now to your question that what if the CLARITY AD is unclear or ambiguous could they still get approval could we still get approval? I think that would be very speculative for me to comment on. What I think would be a reasonable way forward depending on the data would be to have that discussion with the FDA. Because the science here is complex as we've seen. And I think the most important thing is to continue to evaluate the science and the data as it emerges and assess what is the strength of evidence. And I think that is really what is going to make the difference in this case. Thank you.Thank you. I think that first of all we remain committed to Alzheimer's disease. And lecanemab is -- we are very privileged and honored to have 2 Abeta removal agents. Aducanumab we still continue to invest in EMBARK and ENVISION. We think that these will have potentially very critical scientific data that can impact not only the product but also the field. So that remains very important. We continue to invest in early Alzheimer's disease programs. As I mentioned we have a BIIB080 which is our anti-tau ASO and then we have BIB113 which is an OGA inhibitor. Very different sort of approaches to tau pathology. So this remains very important. We have other assets which have yet unnamed pathways and targets which I can't speak about but there are many many others as well. So we remain committed to Alzheimer's disease. We are definitely taking all our learnings from the scientific approach but also on how we would approach clinical development. So we are continuing to strengthen our clinical development expertise in the area. Would we be open to other assets? Yes we continue to look and scour the external opportunities. At any given time we are looking at many assets. And again as I've said the science will drive the way. The science and the value will continue to drive the way. So that's -- I would say yes we are absolutely interested and we continue to remain highly highly committed to Alzheimer's disease. Thank you.Thank you. So first of all CLARITY AD we haven't spoken externally about the powering of the study but Eisai has commented on it. In the Phase II study we had several arms and the outcome was empowered for CDR Sum of Boxes. That is actually very different. Phase II has informed how Phase III has been designed and it is powered to detect a statistically significant difference on CDR Sum of Boxes. So that's one aspect I wanted to cover. The second is that CDR sum of boxes we believe is the right primary endpoint for this patient population and for the MCI in early Alzheimer's disease. This has cognitive and functional elements. We believe that it is the most relevant primary endpoint. And we feel that we are fairly confident in the design of the study to kind of give us the outcome. Now what kind of p-value is very hard I would be speculating so I won't speculate here. But we feel that the study is designed appropriately and that the results would be important to review. I think in terms of clinical meaningfulness we have done a lot of work ourselves. There's a lot of external dialogue. And we do believe that honestly the EMERGE data that we had with the 22% difference is highly clinically relevant and clinically meaningful to KMEs and to patients. So we've done a lot of work around this. And I'm sure you've seen that in the public domain. Beyond that I don't think I can comment on it. Thank you.,0.002871633,0.00340265,0.000322251
164,164,CTAS,Hansen,: Sure Jeff. I don't think that's a fair reflection of our guidance. You think about our guidance of $10.60 to $10.90 that's a 3.5% to 6.4% increase in annual EPS. But you referred to a lower tax rate our tax rate is going to -- based on our guide today is going to go up 5.8% compared to '21. Now that's quite a significant impact. And if you think about the 760 basis points that I referred to in my opening remarks that takes EPS growth from about 11% to 14%. Now certainly the buyback that we had done in the fourth quarter and the first quarter did create some benefit but that still gets to a pretax earnings growth in the range of double-digits. And so it's a pretty good year. And then if you kind of move further up we talked in July about our guidance of implying operating improvement of -- at the low end 0 basis points to 70 at the high end we're still right around in that neighborhood in terms of the guidance that we provided today. And keep in mind that's on the heels of a 310 basis point improvement in operating margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of taxes I think is not a great reflection of really what's going on. The guidance on the EPS side is nice healthy margin improvement pretax increases of right around double digits and then a higher tax rate that pulls that EPS down. Hopefully that gives you a little bit more color on that EPS guidance.: Sure. We certainly -- PPE has been a major factor in that business. And Jeff you're correct in pointing that out. And it was a -- it was really important for our customers over the course of the last year and we invested quite a bit in inventory to be able to serve the customers even if it was at a bit of a lower gross margin for us. But we've seen some nice sequential improvement there. Our 44.8% is still lower than our pre-pandemic of call it 48-ish percent. And so we're -- we still believe we can get back to those kinds of levels. Now the PPE that we've had over the course of the last year tends to drop off a little bit more quickly than the First Aid comes back because as Todd and Paul have referenced we still have a lot of job openings quite a bit fewer people in the workplace today than pre-pandemic. And so as those people come back and as those job openings get filled that creates more hands in our first aid cabinets. And that creates some nice momentum. One of the nice things that we really have seen coming out of the last few quarters is our customers and our new customers so prospects turning into customers are really seeing the value of keeping their employees safe and healthy and our First Aid business really allows us to provide that value to them. And so our new business has been really strong in this first aid cabinet space. But it's coming back. And while we like the momentum we're not there yet. And we do expect to see sequential improvement. And I'll maybe step that back a bit. We expect to see improvement in the year every quarter can be a little bit bumpy here and there. But generally speaking we continue to look for improved gross margin in that business.: Gary I might just add as you're thinking about -- I believe you referred to the next several quarters as I said in my opening remarks we talked last third quarter about $45 million that we did not expect to repeat in our fourth quarter. And so that's going to be -- as you think about the growth of quarter-to-quarter definitely keep that in mind as a third quarter growth impact. Now again as it relates to this PPE look the safety and cleanliness themes that we've sold under for years is really resonating. And we certainly believe that those areas will be larger moving forward than pre-COVID and that certainly is exciting for us.: Yes I'm not -- one other one I might talk about I don't know that Todd mentioned the stock rooms in our laundry facilities and the ability to get those automated and that creates visibility and it creates the opportunity to share. And when we are more efficient in our stockrooms so let me be clear our stockrooms are within our -- within all of our rental facilities they are garment that have been in service already. And so when we are efficient that means we are reusing garments that are already amortizing in our cost structure. And so that's -- that creates revenue generation out of garments that are either already in our cost structure or maybe have been amortized fully. And so we get some real nice incremental margins when we can more efficiently use those or put back those garments into service. SAP has allowed us to get visibility and to be able to improve the use of those garments within our stockroom. So that's another example Scott of something that's really benefiting us.,0.003165762,0.003227651,5.01E-05
165,165,TFC,Bible:,Yes Betsy I think what you're looking at we can maybe check off the line but I think it's just the runoff of purchase accounting. When you look at our new rates going on the books our new volume rates are going on higher than what the existing portfolio is right now. So we are averaging up in most cases across the board there. So I think overall yields will rise and when we have our projections throughout the year I expect net interest margin to continue to rise throughout the year NII to continue to grow just as the interest rates start to climb.If you look at what we've attracted from COVID $80-plus billion of new deposit funding the vast majority of that is noninterest-bearing. And when you look at it we pay the lowest rates of anybody else in the industry. So almost all of it is non-rate sensitive. So we definitely feel that we have betas modeled in to protect what we want to protect out there. There could be a little bit of ebb and flow. But for the most part we will be specific to make sure that we protect our good clients throughout the organization and do that. But right now we've had rates just started to lift off and our deposit betas that we're seeing right now are coming in much less than what we modeled. It's very early into this. But I think right now I think it's not a huge impact on what we've had to pay and we still have the deposits growing for us so non-interest-bearing growth from us in this past quarter as well.Yes. So I think the way we are managing the balance sheet and we've talked about this before is right now we are targeting $15 billion to $20 billion of balances at the Fed. Since the war started in the first quarter we're tilted a little bit towards the heavier side of that just for liquidity purposes. And you really look at the cash flows of the whole balance sheet in total. So we've had deposit growth come in so that's a positive inflow. You have runoff of securities. That's a positive inflow. Our first priority is to lend it out to our clients and to basically do that. Once we've done what we can do from a lending perspective then the residual piece would basically go into the securities portfolio. Now from a securities portfolio perspective we're investing in the past in treasuries MBS. So those are very high-grade very secure-type securities.So yes the mix of what you're doing if you go into treasuries it isn't a forecast Treasuries are in the 270s 280s between the three- to five-year area. MBS are approaching 4%. So it'll blend there. But I would say we'd be on the shorter end of that on a duration perspective but all that is incorporated with the guidance we gave you.Yes. So on the OCI John what I would tell you is Category 3 it's not in our regulatory capital numbers. 99% of our portfolio is guaranteed. So it's just a matter of timing. We're going to get the funding back. It's not a permanent impairment that you see. There are partial offsets once a year you mark your pension plan that Mark will obviously be against what the OCI is which would be some benefit at 12/31. But the real hedge when you really look at this is the economic hedge with deposits. I mean deposits have increased in value. We don't mark to market these non-maturity deposits but we really look at it. The value of that has well exceeded the adjustment than what you saw on the securities portfolio. So that's really I think the offset that you see there. If we wanted to we could put more than 40% into held to maturity I don't think we're there yet where we need to do that from that perspective. I think we feel good with what we've done today.About 6.5% and our modeling even with rates going up higher is basically capped out. So we're really in the six handle and that's where it's going to be until rates start to fall again.Yes. Matt what I would say it's pretty minimal. I mean we had a little bit more reduction in VSRP at the beginning of the quarter. Most of the branch closures were back-end loaded in the quarter. Some of the technology savings that's going to come through that's really all in the second half. We have a little bit more closures in corporate real estate. So I would say it's much more back-end loaded. We maybe got a little bit but the vast majority of it would be in the second half of '22.That's right. Yes. So we were two-thirds of the way through at the end of the year. We made a little bit of progress in the first quarter and we got more to do in the second half of '22.Roughly I would say $400 million to $500 million Mike because we got a little bit of savings in the first quarter.Yes John you kind of go back where we were when we announced this transaction back in '19. Rates were a couple of hundred basis points higher back then. And at that point we thought if we got those cost saves we would be able to come in at the low 50s at that point. We're definitely a different company. We continue to buy and add businesses and all that. But we definitely have at least a forecast from the Fed for it to go up a couple basis points this year and into 2023. So assuming you get the Fed up to 3% 3.5% and we will execute on our cost saves we should have really strong efficiency ratios coming in. Whether we get low 50s or not I think there's a shot that that could happen just because of the asset sensitivity that we have in the Company and what we're seeing in the marketplace our deposit beta is how they perform. So no guarantees from that perspective but rates going up definitely helps on the net interest income side significantly and it's back to kind of where we were back in '19.Yes. So from a cost save perspective obviously technology is the biggest chunk of where the cost savings would come in. So that would be the majority of the savings both data centers application systems FTEs all in that area would basically will be cost savings. We still have more to do on -- a little bit on the VSRP that will help benefit. You have more on corporate real estate reductions. So we have other savings. So I would say overall now that we've moved from the integration to now running and operating the Company we will continue to look for more efficiencies as we operate the Company to give us more fuel to make more investments in the Company as we move forward from that perspective. And I'll put it back to Bill.Yes. So a lot of moving parts there. What I would say is that in spirit I think using a good gauge with a gradual over 200 I think is a good approximation. The deposit betas we talked about earlier we have those being phased in and that's built into these numbers. So we're expecting 25% the first 100 35 and the next 150 after that. Right now we're performing better than that. But we definitely have a pickup in trajectory. If this forward curve does play out as what's embedded in there you will see a big increase in both core net interest margins from where we are today probably peers seen 3% maybe by the end of the year.I think we have good conservative estimates. So there is a chance for outperformance but it's still very early Erika. So you don't really know. But I feel pretty good with these projections and feel good. Bill talked about earlier about our deposit base and our clients and density that we have. So I think we're going to have really positive net interest income as this year plays out in the '23.,0.003354043,0.003865838,0.000319565
166,166,AIG,Zaffino:,Thank you Shane. Operator we are ready for questions.Yes. Thanks Elyse for the question. Good morning. Yes we said we would do a minimum of $1 billion of share repurchases in the second quarter. I think Shane and I tried to do as much detail as we could in our prepared remarks in aligning what our priorities are for capital management. And certainly the Boardâ€™s authorization for an additional $5 billion says that we will continue to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. We think the positioning of the business I mean I think you see in the results we see great opportunities for top line growth. We see it across the world. We see it in the commercial businesses. But also what you would have seen in some of the international thatâ€™s probably mass is that Accident & Health has started to rebound over the last three quarters and we are starting to see top line growth there. So we want to make sure that we are allocating the appropriate capital for growth in driving margin and making the company look at its opportunities on risk-adjusted returns and make sure that we are capitalizing on the market and our discipline. I think really when we get to the actual IPO and Corebridge as a public company we will be able to outline the capital management strategy in more detail but we wanted to provide as much guidance as we could based on what we know today and we would expect to continue to make the progress that we have demonstrated in the earnings call today.Let me take the first part and then I will ask Mark to comment on the loss cost observations. We have seen â€“ when you think about the quality in the results that we produced this quarter when we look at our business what do we look at we look at client retention which continues to improve. We look at new business so we are acquiring a lot of new clients across the world. And so that continues to progress and think that there is a lot of momentum there. We look at rate above loss cost trends. And so that was favorable and we continue to get rate in areas where we believe it is required in terms of its risk-adjusted returns and again with our leadership in terms of deploying capital. Are all the inflation factors considered in the sub-90 well no we obviously are adjusting them but the outperformance that we have been driving wasnâ€™t contemplated either. I mean like we are making more progress on the business at a faster pace and think that we will continue to show that we can grow the business top line and generate the risk-adjusted returns and improvement in combined ratios. Mark do you want to comment on the loss cost?Next question please.Yes. Mark please take that. I mean I think itâ€™s also important to give some context of the portfolio shift as well Mark when we look at loss ratios?Thanks Meyer. I will take that. As I said itâ€™s going to be a headwind in the first quarter will be a tailwind in the second quarter. Once we â€“ there is a couple of moving pieces. We canâ€™t really provide the exact numbers but you can look at like in the second quarter where we purchased down on the North America commercial cash lower retentions as well as in AIG Re where we reduced volatility by buying single shop per occurrence retrocessional at the second quarter and both recovered by the way last year. So we felt that reducing the net retentions was appropriate and carrying that forward into how we were going to structure the 1-1 treaty for AIG as well as retrocessional covers for AIG Re. So we have lower nets than we would have at this time last year. Itâ€™s not uncommon to purchase sometimes mid-term if there is available capacity and you are still trying to evolve a program but we felt very good about the consolidation of those programs at 1-1 and really like the reinsurance that we have in both instances.Thanks.Yes. Let me start. Thanks very much for the question. We have â€“ Mark touched on a little bit and I will ask if he has any additional comments after I make a few observations on the mix of business. But what we have in the first quarter obviously is a big AIG Re which when you look at if you are changing the composition of the portfolio from reducing CAT to doing more proportional you are going to have lower loss ratios higher acquisition costs. And so that will have sometimes impact in terms of how it earns into the first quarter. We also had in terms of the overall General Insurance business the mix changes because on the one hand we wanted to make sure that we were patient with A&H which is a great business for us and travel in terms of its rebound after COVID but not really reducing the overall overhead but it does have an impact in terms of the mix and acquisition expense and loss ratio. The other thing you have to consider where we started I mean the incredible improvement that we have had in the portfolio has been disciplined. We have always talked about underwriting from a risk selection standpoint terms and conditions attachment reducing volatility with supplementing reinsurance and then of course price above loss cost. And I think when you do that sequentially and maintain the same level of discipline we start to see the outcome produced like we had in the first quarter. Mark anything you want to add to that?Itâ€™s hard to predict. I think your first part of the question is do ceding commissions as they start to earn-in benefit the overall expense ratio. The answer is yes. It wasnâ€™t always the case when we were starting the turnaround and â€“ but today we have market terms are better on ceding commissions and that starts to earn in. But I hate to go back to travel and Accident & Health. I mean those really dipped during the pandemic. And the U.S. rebounded first. International is starting to rebound. And those businesses just by its nature of how they are set up have lower loss ratios and higher acquisition expenses. So itâ€™s hard to predict. I mean whatâ€™s the recovery look like whatâ€™s our growth look like whatâ€™s the mix of business look like. So itâ€™s really hard Ryan to give a forecast in terms of what the impact is. What we will focus on all the time is improvement in accident combined ratio. So we are not going to be shifting from one category of loss ratio into â€“ or DAC. I mean we are going to make sure we are focused on the portfolio optimization and mix of business to improve the overall results.Thanks Alex. I mean as you can appreciate preparing for the IPO of Life and Retirement we do have constraints in terms of how much detail we can go into. I think if you look at the S-1 in terms of how we believe we can drive a 12% to 14% ROE over the long-term is something we are very confident about. And if you look at the historical performance of Life and Retirement in terms of its ROE and attributed capital they have done very well. I mean Kevin keeping in mind we have got to be very careful you want to provide maybe one or two items of your observations on the quarter?Alex do you have another question?We provided a lot of detail in Shaneâ€™s prepared remarks. And so I donâ€™t think itâ€™s really worth going back and going through point-by-point. But the most important thing for us at this stage is to sequence really the strategic initiatives we have in front of us the most important being right now the Corebridge IPO. So like thatâ€™s a big project in itself and making sure that Corebridge is set up to be a separate standalone public company and getting the IPO away. Also making sure that all of the things that are done at AIG today that need to be transferred over are worked with Corebridge is the next highest priority. And we have a â€“ our parent expenses you have to think of it as parent and what is General Insurance today coming together as one company. And coming together as one company we want to be very thoughtful about the business we are in in the future what is a target operating model and how do we sequence that in a manner that we are not creating any risk with all the things that we have going on strategically and that we get to the right outcome in the end. And I think our track record has demonstrated whether itâ€™s the underwriting turnaround AIG 200 what we are doing in terms of Corebridge. You should be highly confident we will do it at a pace that is certainly front of mind but at the same time making sure that we have all the very important pieces of what we are doing in the separation done very well. And so thatâ€™s kind of the timeframe but itâ€™s really not going to be what month what quarter itâ€™s going to be how do we execute things and then sequence the next priority which will be how we bring parent and General Insurance together.If I may let me just â€“ I just want to thank everybody for our clients our distribution partners and our colleagues have been tremendous in terms of the work that they have done and the contribution that they have driven to get to these results. So everybody have a great day. Thank you for your time.,0.002799547,0.003517747,0.000382106
167,167,CTVA,Magro:,Tim do you want to take that?Hi Alex. Good morning. We'll ask Robert King to answer that question for you.Yes and just Alex on this backdrop. So look we said that the fundamentals are going to be quite strong. Really if you look at crop commodity prices what it's telling us is that the world needs to produce more food. So we not only need â€“ we're talking about a mix here which is important but we need more acreage to be put into production. And then of course we need technology to drive productivity yield on every acre we have. And so there seems to be a shift underway to take the top technology in terms of genetics and traits for seed. And then of course the top technologies in CP to drive every last bushel per acre we think that this will continue. If you look at farmer economics around the world things are quite robust. Farmers are in a good financial position. In fact if you look at the U.S. farmers the predictions are that this year would be a record revenue year for U.S. farmers. And I believe the second most profitable in the last decade. So there's high motivation as Tim mentioned to get that crop in the ground and then to protect and grow that crop and I think what you're going to see that that we're very well positioned as an integrated company to catalyze it on that trend but also to help farmers drive productivity sustainably.Yes. Great question. And let me take so we're still really excited about the adoption of the system. And I would say as we sit here today again with a relatively small amount of the crop planted we're holding to that original guide around at least 40% of the U.S. soy acres will be planted with an Enlist E3 variety. So that holds steady and why we can't update that right now is we only have so much visibility to what the 100 licensees are in the marketplace what they're ultimately selling and we'll have a much better understanding of what ultimately when in the ground is we get past the midyear and after the planting season. So feel good about that in terms of the adoption of the Enlist herbicide and really getting the full value of the system. We're over 80% treated with the Enlist herbicide so really high utilization. And again I think that goes to the value that customers are seeing. So it's three seasons really into Enlist E3 soybeans. And we can confidently say when you look at the seed adoption as well as utilization of the chemistry it's become a very trusted option for growers and growers see it as a go-to option. And we don't see that slowing down. Your question around genetics and where we're headed here I mean this is going to be a really important season for us and we're going to be doing extensive demonstration trials of a new class of Corteva developed E3 varieties that we anticipate ramping up for 2023. So the question is â€“ your point is when are you going to see it I think you're going to start to see that in terms of demonstration in 2023 or 2022 in the field in anticipation of a significant move in 2023. And again once we get through the planning season we'll be in a better position to update that 40% number for planting of E3 seed but feel very comfortable that that we'll be at least at that level and again at that high utilization on the chemistry system.Yes. Hi Frank. So let me give you where we are. I'm probably not going to answer your question directly today. You need to come to Johnston Iowa and you'll get that answer in September but let me just kind of frame the journey that we've been on. So look I said this before when I started with the organization but overall I'm very pleased with the strategic direction of Corteva. I do believe that the company is quite uniquely positioned when you look at our products and our brand portfolio the innovation pipeline but more than the innovation pipeline the science and innovation competencies and capabilities that we have in Johnston and here in Indianapolis. And then of course Tim mentioned it today. Our customer and channel reach is truly unprecedented. So the work that we're focused on right now is really we're going to provide a little bit more clarity in September on the strategic direction but I'd say it's tweaking. It's really clarity around what we will focus on and what we won't focus on. We're going to try to really â€“ with the organizational changes we've made to move to two global business units. We're really trying to drive accountability into our culture streamlining and simplifying the product portfolio will be the next effort. So that effort is well underway right now we're looking at the global portfolio we're looking at where we operate around the world and we're trying to make the decisions on how do we enhance performance and drive speed of business. And so that work is progressing very nicely. And by the time we get to the September Investor and Innovation session that we're planning we'll be able to give you at least a view on the operational and financial journey that we believe the company will be on. And by that point we will have made some other decisions. And then of course the important part of September will be and the reason we're having it at Johnston is we'd like to demonstrate some of our technology. We're very proud of what we've been able to build over the last several years. And I think it's time that we sort of start sharing more of that with our stakeholders. So stay tuned.Arun â€“ maybe operator you can go to the next is there another question. We canâ€™t hear Arun.Yes. So Adam good question. So I would say that the products that we're selling today are highly value and Pioneer's been very supportive of Enlist E3. So this isn't about all of a sudden Pioneer's going to be in the game with Enlist 3 our overall reach in the soy market with our brands is somewhere in the â€“ call it in the mid-30s would be what our brand share is. And the majority of that would be in the Pioneer side. So clearly we've got a strong reach in the marketplace with our owned seed brands and we've got over 100 licensees that are in the marketplace selling Enlist E3. So it's a material move and as we ramp up our proprietary genetics it's going to have a strong impact not just in terms of I think the performance of our products and the experience that our customers receive but it's also going to have a very positive impact on our financial performance as well. And the underlying financial health of our soybean seed business specifically and also our overall seed business. So a strong move forward as we move into 2023.Okay. And that concludes today's call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva. We hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Thank you.,0.003146946,0.003834844,0.000431611
168,168,COF,Fairbank:,Hi. Good evening Betsy.So Betsy we continue to see elevated payment rates across our customer base and while lately itâ€™s been sort of flattening out if you will I mean payment rates are just well above pre-pandemic levels. And while not a perfect proxy you can see these trends in our trust metrics where the payment rate in March remained close to 50%. One of the more recent drivers of higher repayment rates is really the flip side of amazingly strong credit and healthy consumer balance sheets and we certainly expect consumer credit to gradually normalize maybe you know itâ€™s kind of been happening a little slower than one might otherwise expect. And I certainly believe payment rates will remain sort of the flip side of really strong credit. So over time the normalization of credit plausibly leads to some normalization of higher payment -- of normal excuse me a payment rate. I think there is another phenomenon happening sort of on little cat feet behind our payment rate numbers and that is that each year we are gaining more and more traction with heavy spenders. Also you may remember for years we talked about gosh this goes all the way back to the Great Recession Capital Oneâ€™s systematic avoidance of high balance revolvers which leaves a lot of revenue and earnings on the table during the good times but is a move for the sake of resilience. But I think this sort of systematic effects of avoiding high balance revolvers and the systematic effects of more and more traction with heavy spenders also has created somewhat of a sort of more sustainable change in our payment rate as well. But certainly probably the biggest factor of the moment is the rate at which consumers are being so creditworthy and putting so much of their money into payments.Well yeah let me just -- why donâ€™t I do this Betsy let me just pull up and sort of talk about marketing overall and then we can kind of come back to the quarter that we just had. There are few things driving our marketing levels higher these days. First of all the opportunities that we see. We are seeing attractive growth opportunities across our businesses and we are leaning hard into them while the opportunities are there. In our Card business we have continued to expand our products and the marketing channels that we are originating in and these opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology transformation which is enabled us to leverage more data access more channels leverage machine learning models and enable customized solutions. So we are seeing significant traction in originations across our business. And I want to note that so much of our Card business overall and our growth is in our Branded Card franchise as opposed to co-brand and private label partnerships. And by the way we also like those businesses but for Capital One thatâ€™s a relatively smaller proportion of our business. And in Branded Card we enjoy the full economics of the business and we own the customer franchise. So while the industry doesnâ€™t track data on this I think our share growth in Branded Card s is particularly noteworthy. And Branded Card is of course as the word implies itâ€™s about our brand and we continue to invest in the companyâ€™s brand and in the flagship products. And some of the strength that you see in our revenue margin comes from having so much Branded Card where we own all the economics. But the flip side of that is that the marketing and the brand building are entirely on us and that all shows up in our marketing numbers. But thatâ€™s an absolute centerpiece of building a highly valuable franchise. Now second important driver of our growing marketing spend is the continued traction we are getting in our more than decade long journey to drive more and more our market with a focus on the heavy spenders. So we launched our venture Card way back in 2010 and that was the beginning of that strategic push for heavy spenders. But it hasnâ€™t just been about flagship Card s itâ€™s been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and thatâ€™s about great products with heavy reward content itâ€™s about great servicing itâ€™s about customer experiences tailored for heavy spender lifestyles and of course an exceptional digital experience. So for years we have been on this journey and every year we have had growing traction and while our whole franchise of spenders has grown nicely we have grown even faster with heavier spenders. And with each year of success we have had the license to stretch a little higher up market and we are continuing to invest to make that possible. And lately you have seen our launch of our travel portal which has garnered some rave reviews in the marketplace. You have seen the launch of airport lounges which have a special appeal to the top of the market and the frequent travelers. And last fall we launched Venture X which moved us into the next tier of premium Card s. And that launch has been very successful and we continue to invest in the growth of that product. You can see some of the results from our continued quest for heavy spenders in the tremendous purchase volume growth that we have had. Over any time period you pick over the last decade or shorter time periods you will find Capital One with -- posting really high in your top of the league tables if not at the top of the league tables purchase volume growth. And also note that almost all of the heavy spender growth is in our Branded Card s and thatâ€™s why you can see such strength in spend velocity and our revenue margin. This journey for the heavy spender has a different economic mix than some of our traditional Card business. It has higher upfront cost brand building higher upfront costs of marketing and promotions and of course investment in high end experiences. But long-term value of the heavy spender franchise is tremendous with high spend levels strong margins very low losses low attrition and a lift to our brand and really the rest of our franchise. So the spender franchise is already making its mark on many line items of our financial performance and thatâ€™s a continuing long-term benefit of these investments. I just want to mention the third factor contributing to the higher marketing if some of the traction that we are getting with our new digital offerings including Auto Navigator Capital One Shopping and our National Bank. And just to comment on the National Bank which unlike Capital One unlike other banks who are driving growth through bank acquisitions we are focused on continuing to build our bank organically which of course does take marketing investment. So that was just take me a chance to share with you what is behind the pretty high levels of marketing that you are seeing and the great opportunities that we see for our franchise and to grow it. Now due in part to the current marketplace environment and importantly capitalizing on our strategic quest those quest being our building of the modern tech stack and the continued move up market. This has -- these things are contributing to driving higher marketing levels these days. So that is -- that sort of a pulling out sort of a narrative on why it is that we are leaning hard into marketing and itâ€™s a combination of sort of the opportunity at the moment as well as capitalizing on the journey thatâ€™s been many years in the making. Typically we have a seasonal dip in marketing levels this year. An important contributor to our marketing was things related to that for example the launch of venture Card s early spend bonuses and things like that. So things are not -- itâ€™s not quite as strong and a seasonal effect this year as it has been in other years. We are not specifically giving a guidance on the rest of the year but I just wanted to share with you why it is that we are leaning in the marketing whatâ€™s driving that and I am -- as you can probably tell from the answer I am really enthused about our opportunities and we are though leaning into take advantage of them and a lot of that is about marketing.Yeah. So Moshe with respect to the lower end consumers itâ€™s less about letâ€™s imagine we donâ€™t have to do very much imagining to envision environments that are more difficult than this one where the consumers in a more challenged place where the competitors are -- have gone a whole notch more aggressive. And what I think is more our pattern in that case is to particularly use the credit line lever to manage the risk as opposed to just a big dial back say in origination machines. So we just more cautious online try to continue to build the franchise maybe not as aggressively as sometimes. But again we have over our 30 years Moshe in building sort of Main Street franchise really do a lot of the regulating and things on the loan side . On heavy spenders we continued to find so much traction and what I have often said about the quest for heavy spenders unlike a lot of things that I have seen in our business journey this is not a thing that is very well suited to a blitz here a pullback of blitz and a pull back. Now that doesnâ€™t mean we wouldnâ€™t be dialing the knobs up and down on certain things like marketing or choices or product or whatever. But this is and I think there is a reason that not very many players are really really successful at the top of the market. This is about really building a franchise at that end of the market. Thatâ€™s not just taking regular consumer products and addressing them up with more rewards or the fancy advertising and the -- thatâ€™s why I mentioned this journey that were like in the 12th year of the journey where we declared we are going to just keep moving up market. One canâ€™t do it overnight. Itâ€™s something you have to earn along the way. But all of our metrics continue to show traction and success traction on brand metrics as well and pretty much all the customer metrics you have seen whatâ€™s happening on purchase volumes the -- when we track the things that we have booked over the years we sort of love the annuities we are booking. So that to me is something that we are going to keep pursuing as we have for a long time. But what we will -- the things that we will throttle along the way are certain marketing choices certain product choices but that one that I partly shared -- I want to share this a little bit more about this today that thatâ€™s a journey that Capital One has been on as part of our central part of our strategy in Card for a lot of years.Okay. Don thank you. We have been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years. And the pandemic also accelerated technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and certainly in banking. And I think for every player the clock is ticking on their tech readiness and companies are waking up to the investment imperative. And we have talked about the investment flowing into fintechs is breathtaking and the arms race for tech talent is fierce is that I have seen in any time in my career and in any job family. So there is an urgency in responding to the marketplace. But I do want to also say that the fast-moving marketplace is also the creator of our opportunity and I think Capital One is uniquely positioned to take advantage of that opportunity and thatâ€™s why we are investing now. So really this is very similar message to what I said last quarter. What I have been saying for a long time we are still very focused on the opportunity to drive operate -- operating efficiency improvement over the longer term. The engine that powers it is revenue growth and digital productivity gains. But the timing of efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. So but delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be an incredibly important north star to us and frankly one of the most important payoffs of our technology journey and an important element of how we deliver long-term value. So I think you have sort of seen -- you can see some of the effects of what I am talking about in the first quarter operating efficiency and when you adjust for gains from portfolio sales in the quarter. So I think itâ€™s very similar conversation to what I was saying last time we can see some of the evidence of that in the quarterly numbers but the current pressure doesnâ€™t change at all our belief in the longer term opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement.Oh! Sorry. Sorry.You wanted to...Yeah. So when you are talking about yeah Commercial you are talking about here in our business Card -- business Credit Card. You may have seen the ads on TV that talk about no preset spending limit thatâ€™s more complicated way to just say in a sense not a credit limit that gets hard wired. This is something that is you know dynamically there isnâ€™t a credit line per say this is dynamic transaction underwriting in real time. Itâ€™s a very hard thing to build. Itâ€™s taken us years to get there and itâ€™s absolutely a -- one of the many many benefits of the tech transformation we have done and the journey to the cloud in the building of modern applications in modern platforms. And so I have always said to -- investors will often ask where can I see where is the -- I want to reach out and touch the benefit of your tech transformation and all the money we have spent on that. And I have said look there is not going to be any one thing that you point out and say oh my gosh thatâ€™s I now see everything. This is about this journey -- is a journey that when we -- when years ago when we kind of said some day we would like to do this thing over here some day we would like to do that. We would also like to have much better efficiency we would like to better risk management we would like to do lots of things and a striking thing was all the things that we wanted to do usually in life they are -- you have to pick some and itâ€™s all about trade-offs. What I am struck by in this journey is a shared path to all the things that years ago we set out to do and that path relates to building modern technology across the company and from the bottom of the tech stack up and that is what we have done. And then over time you as investors will see manifestations of that. See while that Auto Navigator product Capital One built that can underwrite every car in America and for any consumer in a fraction of the second thatâ€™s striking and then one sees well also -- you actually have a no preset spending limit thatâ€™s striking. And we didnâ€™t do the journey for the sake of any one of those but I think on an increasing basis investors will see examples of things that are -- that stand on the shoulders of the years of investment we have made in technology. And things that also by themselves like this Card thing we are talking about is itself within that journey that took a bunch of years. But itâ€™s all about working backwards from wins with customers and thatâ€™s why we are doing that.So John as I often say with the smile Capital One was one of the original fintechs. We are a fintech -- before fintechs were word. But if you think about what we did is we built a lending company we started with Cards that we ultimately building a broad based financial institution. One thing that enabled that journey to happen is the advent of the capital markets and we were able to ride the very mediocre growth Capital One in the â€˜90s based on securitizations and things and so we were very grateful for that. But at the same time we then did probably one of the most things that I think most shocked our investors I guess it shocked because you spent a lot of years talking about it before we did it but striking thing when we chose to transform our company to a traditional bank balance sheet because we want to create much greater resilience in our funding. So the reason I mentioned that is as we were in the old days and as fintechs that are built on securitization have an opportunity to grow quickly. But they also have a just an inherent structural challenge with resilience. So for all of them they need to and their investors need to keep a careful eye on that. I want to talk just a little bit about you mentioned some of the lending results and some of the uptick. So first of all we shouldnâ€™t be surprised to see upticks and delinquencies just for companies in general whether they are banks or some of the fintechs. Typically companies that have a less of a history of consumer credit data are probably more challenged with respect to how to read this rearview mirror. I mean for example letâ€™s just say that you created a fintech in the last couple of years how would one look in the rear view mirror and determine where resilience is and where it isnâ€™t since in general pretty much everybody did well. So thatâ€™s one of the challenge any new company has is building deepen of credit history to do that. So Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s just a challenge they bring to the table itâ€™s not their fault. There is nothing. Itâ€™s just -- itâ€™s a structural thing. The other thing that always happens with normalization as normalization tends to happen faster on front books than back books and so part of what you may be seeing on fintechs is if their high growth fintechs just the proportion that their front book represents as a percentage of the whole is quite different and it would be surprising if they didnâ€™t normalize faster given that typically front books normalize faster than back books. And a lot of us have seasoned back books with years of experience with them and thatâ€™s also very helpful in normalization journey. So as one that was an original fintech I have great fascination with the fintechs lot of respect for a lot of things they are doing. But also know that there is some structural things that they are going to have to confront that they and their investors will have to keep an eye on.,0.004066898,0.010070503,0.002292547
169,169,AFL,Amos:,Hey let's come back to the swap because we pulled up some of the numbers. And so we can answer that question more directly. So Eric why don't you kind of give us a little bit an idea.But I want to make a comment is I've always said I like evolution not revolution. And for you that have been following our stock for 10 years or more I just want to tell you what a sophisticated model we have today and how it's evolved not only from Eric and Brad and the team and what they've done but also our board and specifically Tom is Chairman of what they've done from an investment standpoint. It is very gratifying to hear as we get into such volatility and change in the last year or so even in the last three months with the Yen. And yet we have prepared for and to hear these answers I just want all of you to know what hard work and dedication they've done through Fred and Max. And what's gone on. So Max I think you were going to make a comment.Well I'm going to let Virgil but let me just say just take our company for example. Today we really have our first officer meeting after for lunch today. And we've got about 150 people coming and that is normally that includes our Directors and our Directors. And that's about a little lower than what we normally have that pre-pandemic maybe we would have had up to 200. So it gives you an idea of how things are getting back to normal. They're not quite there. But as I said I look forward to happen in the second half I look for everything to kind of move back but it will be a new normal. I mean there will be a certain amount of people that will work from home. But things are moving back. So let me let Virgil because I'm real pleased of what Teresa and Virgil had done in terms of having an impact on sales. And I've been very pleased with persistency until this issue that just came up in the first quarter. And I know they'll address it and fix that problem too as we go forward. So go ahead Virgil you can start and if Teresa wants to make comments she can do whatever she wants. She's the boss.Yes so I'll say that the first quarter is certainly higher than we anticipated I think and more higher than most anticipated for us. So we're very pleased with that we certainly will see the same seasonality definitely in the third and fourth quarters where you'll see the majority of our production. Again we're looking to maintain this consistency in the second quarter. But I will tell you that the momentum and in a lot of has to do with two the contributing factors we mentioned earlier that have come from our buy-to-build with our premier life and absence products and disability those products really is the selling season right now early in the year. And those sales will come through in Q4 so the growth and the seasonality of the highest impact you'll see is definitely going to be in Q4. We'll look to maintain this consistent momentum from Q1 going into Q2. But again I expect more on the third and fourth quarters.Yes Alex I think that the way you sort of described it is a reasonable description of how our long-term hedging model actually works. Capital in Japan obviously is stronger with a weakening Yen and you know SMR sensitivities you can go back to our fab disclosures and we give those sensitivities there. So you can sort of calculate what the impact is on the capital position in Japan. And also if you travel over to the holding company in this quarter alone because we issue debt denominated in Yen you saw our leverage dropped 60 basis points simply because of FX move in the first quarter. So that ultimately leads to a somewhat higher debt capacity over time and then you should also expect that over time as the $5 billion of forwards as they settle they convert into cash. At the end of the first quarter we had $3.6 billion of unencumbered cash at the holding company. And I use the term unencumbered and that's actually quite important in this context because it excludes any collateral receipt that we have. And obviously that will add to that pile of cash if the FX rate continues to be at this current level we have forwards that the settlements will spread out there's no specific sort of tower as generally settle we got some forward settle every month. So over time this hedging program will then convert into cash. So short-term you're going to see our EPS obviously get hit by it from the translation impact. But over time it leads to deployment opportunities by lower leverage FX words converted into cash. And then also long-term you have a higher capital position in Japan associated with the dollar portfolio that we have in Japan that strengthens the SMR in a scenario weakening Yen all these sort of balances out to some extent over the long-term. As it relates to deployment of additional capital it follows the same criteria that we have for all deployments of capital that we deploy where we see a good risk return based on an IRR basis.Yes so first of all the derivatives housed at the corporate level the mark to marketing pack does not run through the GAAP EPS number but the amortize hedge income does. And that's a fairly stable number. So if you look at the results for corporate this quarter we're running a little bit high on expenses in the quarter and a little bit low on NII in the quarter the NII was somewhat depressed by our tax credit investments that run as a negative -- that run as a negative through the NII line. But then obviously you have a favorable offsetting impact on the tax credit line. As discussed earlier we do have most of the assets at the holding company are floating rate in nature. So obviously that means that as the short-end of the yield curve now has increased and come up you're going to see a little bit of a pickup in NII over time. So if you look at the results of this quarter there's some puts and takes and a lot of moving parts but generally I think it's a decent run rate for the current.And Tom just to give you some more color on it if you take the incurred impact from COVID in the quarter on our normalized benefit ratio was a little bit north of 100 basis points. So if you take that and you isolate that component that will take your normalized benefit ratio in the first quarter smack in the middle of our range of 67% to 69%.Well if they don't they won't make bonuses. So it's going certainly going to impact them. But Virgil you want to comment?And one thing I would add and Virgil can add color to it but one column that you may be looking at in the recruiting is the recruited agents through brokers. And remember to some of our comments at year-end in this past quarter we're focusing on driving sales now through small business brokers as well which has not been historically a focused effort of our company. And as a result you saw the recruiting level of broker agents go up dramatically in 2021 averaging over upwards of 1 200 to 1 500. Now what does that mean when you recruit a small business broker what it means is you've appointed them and they've appointed you to be eligible to sell product through that broker it doesn't mean you're selling product through that broker. And so one of the things that Virgil is talking about when he uses the term conversion is that we're now working on those large amount of brokers that were signed up and appointed last year we're now focusing on converting them into actually generating sales through their brokerage platform. So that's a big piece and there's a lot of runway yet to go on that.Well we can't go into any detail regarding Japan Post. They've always been you know since inception of Japan Post they have asked us to never go into detail or go into detail. Basically they stopped last year and they have regained a position but it's still very low. And all I can tell you is they have committed to us that they are dedicated to seeing a return to stronger production. And I'm expecting that that as you all know there are large shareholders I feel like that's important. And the message that I've been saying is those two tasks gather with them and so we'll have to wait and see. But I'm encouraged about the production but I can't if this give you any more detail other than to say we have a wonderful relationship. They know what we want they want to help us. It's just the timing and how to do it. But there's no problem that I can tell you other than just getting it started again. There's absolutely nothing. They're happy with us. We're happy with them and but we want to see the production now.,0.003197163,0.003707886,0.000442968
170,170,TRV,Frey:,Ryan it's Dan. Yes so not real big movements there. I think Greg gave you what's a pretty straightforward story to the quarter about a point better in the loss ratio really tied to earned pricing being ahead of what we're seeing in the loss environment and about 1 point of improvement in the expense ratio. To your point there are other things that will impact quarters differently and there's some variability from quarter-to-quarter. This quarter the net of those things when we compare to what we saw in the first quarter of a year ago it was just about a wash.Ryan it's Dan. I'd just add and I think you were getting to it in the tail end of your question. Cyber it's not a huge percentage of the premium base within Bond & Specialty. So it's an important line of business that everybody is paying attention to It's not a huge component of the book.Yes Greg it's Dan. I'm not sure that I would try to break it into its pieces. We're managing to a total return. And within that we're trying to manage to what we are comfortable with from an expense ratio perspective. So we made a lot of progress in improving the expense ratio from where we were 5 or 6 years ago. We're pretty -- we said when it got down to the 30 level a couple of years ago we were pretty comfortable somewhere around 30. Coming out of last year we signaled that we thought this year would be around 29.5. And all I was really trying to give you in my comments was that's still sort of what we're planning for for this year. I don't know exactly where it's going to come up but that's the neighbourhood of where we would expect it to come out A little better than that in the first quarter of the year that's partially due to the fact that premium volumes were a little stronger than we would have expected. It's also partially due to the fact that there's some timing from quarter-to-quarter in terms of what's going to come through expenses. But we are managing the strategic investments we're making to move the business forward balanced with expense discipline to make sure that we're continuing to improve productivity and efficiency also balanced with what our view is of where the top line is going. So we're looking at all those -- all 3 of those things together and saying we were in the 32s a few years ago we got down to 30. We told you this year we think that will go down to about 29.5 and then the next step will be to go down to 29. But it's really balancing all those 3 things together.Sure Greg. It's a good question because this is the quarter in which we actually flip from new money rates being below what's embedded in the portfolio as has been the case for the past several years. By the time we exit the quarter we're -- and you see that in the fact that the portfolio is now in an unrealized loss position as opposed to an unrealized gain position. But exiting the quarter we think that new money yields are somewhere between 50 and 70 basis points higher than what's running off. And so as the portfolio slowly turns over and that is contributing to our increased view compared to the outlook that we had provided at year-end in terms of what will happen to fixed income NII increasing now as we get to the latter part of 2022.So Elyse it's Dan. I'll take that one and I'll say that we're thinking about especially in this environment with exposure near all-time highs you've got to compare what we're doing on the total pricing side including the piece of exposure that behaves like rate with what's happening in the overall loss environment. So as you heard in Greg's comments and in Alan's comments we have reflected a higher level of severity tied to inflation in our view of what we're booking for losses in business insurance. That's largely tied to higher levels of inflation. Higher levels of inflation also bring with it really an offsetting benefit as you think about what we'll earn in on a go-forward basis from higher exposures. So things like higher wages paid to the same workers. So we're going to get a higher exposure and a higher premium on the same risk as opposed to increases in exposure related to things like more workers where we're collecting more premium but there's more risk because you've got additional workers. So our view of the loss environment is higher. Whether you put that in loss trend or whether you leave your loss trend unchanged and book a medium-term over-the-top severity on top mechanically you're going to get to the same answer. If you believe that the inflationary impact is going to be somewhat persistent at least over the medium term if you'd put it in loss trends that's reflected in the numbers that Greg talked about in terms of a point of margin expansion in the quarter and in the commentary that on a written basis with the production results we saw this quarter we expect margins to continue to expand going forward.I think directionally that's the way to think about it Elyse. But keep in mind as you said there is both sides of the equation and we're going to and are seeing the benefit on the exposure piece as well.And keep in mind Elyse we're talking about very strong margins at the time and saying even at this level we continue to expect that we're expanding margins. I mean these are some of the best underlying combined ratio that Business Insurance has seen in the last 14 or 15 years. So to have retention at all-time highs when margins are as strong as they are feels great.Yes I echo those exact same thoughts.Yes pretty much Tracy. I mean we -- which is one of the reasons why when we talk about book value per share we almost always talk about adjusted book value per share the unrealized gain or loss position in the portfolio we think of as we have duration in the portfolio interest rates are going to move we're going to have an unrealized gain or loss it's not really driving the economics of how we think about the capital position of the company.Yes. And it also gets Meyer sort more and more difficult. So in terms of did we have any sort of directly COVID-related charges that become a very -- it was never a big story for us in the first place and it's certainly not a big story now. Then in terms of the underlying loss environment other -- things that were indirectly impacted by COVID I think it just gets sort of harder and harder to parse out what is a change in COVID and what is just the new normal in terms of whether it's people working from home or things like that. So I think your reading is right. There's not a big story in the quarter related to COVID.Josh are you talking about on a consolidated basis or one of the segments.Okay. So I think there is seasonality in different parts of the segments. Greg did call out in his fourth quarter comments whether property losses not related to cat were a little better than our expectations. And I think we've had this conversation Josh before. We really don't think about the think about that sort of sequential quarter-to-quarter reconciliation. There are different things that occur in different quarters. So I think the most apples-to-apples comparison in our view is Q1 versus Q1 and that's the way we do it.Sure. So in BI for the quarter we -- so again the pieces I gave you $113 million in total for the quarter for BI the largest piece being comp that was $80 million to $85 million. I gave you the -- we had $45 million of a charge for environmental related to the older years. So that leaves you with the other things. So the general liability lines a fair amount of favorability spread across many accident years property a modest amount of favorability spread across many accident years CMP net favorability from a number of accident years and the international business showed some favorable development in PYD as well. None of those things were sort of individually significant which is why I didn't call them out in my comments but we saw favorable development in those lines as well.Yes. The one line I didn't mention was auto and not because it was a huge outlier but I don't think that the net result of auto is much more than a wash within Business Insurance.Yes pretty -- to the degree that there's any Alex I think it's pretty small. The other thing that we've used to describe reserving in the uncertainty of the sort of COVID environment and core closure environment is that we've tried to remain cautious. And so I think we have tried to remain cautious. So even though -- some of the data might still be indicating some modest benefits from frequency we're making sure that we're booking losses to allow for what might come through either later or on the severity side. So not really a big benefit coming through the quarter.David it's Dan. I think mathematically if you just took a point in that equation that would get you to somewhere around breakeven and we're telling you that we think on a written basis margins are still expanding. It is difficult and I appreciate what everybody is trying to do. It's difficult to have a rule of thumb for how much exposure behaves like rate because as I said in the answer to an earlier question the things that are driving exposure can vary from period to period whether it's inflation driven or units of risk driven the lines of business mix changes from quarter-to-quarter and that impacts it. But I think the short answer I would say is when we're looking at the level of exposure that we wrote in the first quarter I think more than 1 point of that we think of as behaving like rate but I really wouldn't try to put much finer point on it than that. The other thing I'll just add David is loss trend for this purpose is really a very blunt instrument. And that sort of one number aggregating loss trend across that we look at it at a very granular level. So we just don't approach it at the sort of macro â€“ sort of level that you do which is I think why we're all sort of looking at each other wondering how to respond to that. And I get -- just trying to get to some measure of cost of goods sold it's just a blunt instrument and it's hard to do. And the other thing I'll say is loss trend frequency changes in long-term view of frequency and severity that's just a mechanic for booking losses and there are other mechanics for booking losses. And so it's just -- it's really the only thing impacting a quarter. So I just â€“ just cautioning you against the -- looking at something that seems very simple and thinking that's the answer.,0.007301283,0.023318827,0.0080634

172,172,CARR,Gitlin:,Deane on Europe. Keep in mind that last year when we had Chubb it was close to 30% of our sales. And now without Chubb it's closer to 22% of our sales. So Europe has become less exposure for us. What I will tell you is that we're watching this very carefully but Q1 orders were very strong. They were up double digits. April orders have continued to be strong for us in Europe. So there's no tangible signs of weakness. But obviously with everything going on in the world we'll continue to watch it quite carefully.Yes. The number of overdue to our customer demand is about the same number as what you mentioned for 4Q. It's in the few hundred million dollar range that we could ship if we didn't have any supply chain issues. The root of a lot of our issues I would tell you 2/3 of our issue are chips. Chips cannot recover fast enough and they continue to be extremely painful for us. So I do believe our team is doing all the right things which gives us some level of optimism as we get towards the second half of this year into next year. The things that we're doing to help ourselves as we get into 2H are number one the direct relationships with many of our key chip OEMs like TI and Microchip and STMicro and those. And they're doing their best to support us where I know they have a lot of customers that are pushing on them but we're really establishing these direct relationships. And then we're really -- we're redesigning many of our key chips. So we will have 30% of our critical IC's redesigned by the end of this quarter here in Q2 and then 50% by year-end. So that gives us a lot more optionality where we redesign around chips that are actually available. So that gives us some level of optimism while we wait for the capacity of our chip OEMs to come online in '23. But supplier on-time delivery and line stoppages it's about what we've seen. There are some signs of hope. But chips are not only impacting us they're impacting our suppliers as well. So that's the biggest thing that we need to watch in terms of availability.Well we have a small army working on it globally. It's something that -- it's unfortunate honestly because what we've had to do is reallocate engineers that we want working on new product introduction to redesigning chips; so it is what it is. I think our engineering and operations teams are doing all the right things but this cannot recover quickly enough.Yes. Light commercial I think it's clear we've gained significant share by the way while raising prices significantly. So -- we saw I would tell you over 400 basis points of share over the last year or so and that continued into 1Q. We saw about 100 -- over 100 basis points of share gain in Q1. So proud of the team on Light commercial because it's been pricing it's been operational performance it's been innovation it's been customer stickiness it's been all the things that we push and the team is executing well in a strong market. And Applied is probably flattish; I think we've seen some share gains in China and North America and Europe's may be slightly less than what we thought. But overall I would tell you Applied share is probably flattish in 1Q.Yes. In the first quarter Tommy North America was the strongest. That was up around 20% Europe was around 10% and Asia was around 10%. So overall around 15% in the first quarter. We've sort of said high single digits across the board for the rest of the year but we're going to have to keep an eye on it. China is the biggest watch item right now. China would probably be down for us in the second quarter because we do have a couple of facilities in Shanghai that we need to get reopened as soon as possible so we can support our customers. The good news on Overall Applied is; Number one the underlying trends that we talked about at the beginning of the call the underlying demand remains very strong. ABI metrics as we mentioned stays very strong. Aftermarket for HVAC up over 10% the ALC/Controls business high margins really differentiated product lines that doesn't get enough credit up double digits. So a lot of strength especially in some key verticals like data centers and warehouse education health care commercial buildings coming back online. So a lot to like there. I would tell you the one thing we got to watch very acutely right now is China.Well on the first we continue to have plenty of cash and firepower for more M&A. So we're actively working our pipeline along the lines of what we talked about at our Investor Day with a huge focus on sustainability leadership things that relate to aftermarket and our overall trends. So if we had the right deal could we do a deal obviously north of $1 billion we certainly could and would if it made sense. In terms of our Carrier ventures we were very excited to launch it and announced a couple of important deals with OhmConnect and AddVolt one on the energy management side one on batteries as we think about our reefer [ph] unit. So right in the core of what we're focused on -- and we have a pipeline Jennifer Anderson and the team working a pipeline of a number of interesting investments we're looking at. And the cadence will be opportunistic and episodic. So -- it's not that we've set aside a certain budget for that team. These are typically around $5 million type investments. And if we see the right investments there we'll make them. Patrick anything to add to that?Yes we're seeing a transition to a more system-level sales. So we had a key win recently Vlad in Ohio for example where we sold a broad suite of solutions. It included HVAC and included building management systems. They had some UV light upgrades to the school. So we're seeing a transition. We were very fortunate to sell a bunch of OptiClean units and point solutions and we're seeing a transition to more sustainable system-level solutions. Because what we're seeing from the school district is the realization that ventilation not only helps with things like indoor air quality and -- but 1 in 13 kids in schools have asthma. So obviously it's important for COVID and the spread of airborne illnesses and diseases but it also helps with asthma. It helps with cognitive functionality. We've done studies to show that better ventilation and lower CO2 levels improve testing scores in schools. So what we're seeing from the schools that we interact with is looking for a more structural sustainable solution. And the good news is with -- especially with SR3 funds being released they have the funding to make long overdue investments.Well remember what we said is that we said that we would increase our automation hours from 3 million to 6 million over the next -- between now and 2026. And remember that's on a base of say 30 million or so manufacturing hours. So it becomes a much higher percentage of our total hours. Obviously you have to look at your variable costs that you're eliminating and replacing with automated hours. Obviously there's an investment that goes with that. But you also see benefits around quality and some of the other things that get into other benefits and things. So there's a lot of benefits that we're seeing from the automation investments. And we expect that to continue and continue at a pretty good clip. Anything you want to add Patrick?We've seen no evidence of that. It's something -- again we watch this market which is -- evolves on such a short cycle. We watch it very very carefully. We've seen no evidence of mixing down. In fact we've seen the opposite a lot of desire for our higher-end Infinity systems. We've seen no evidence of replacing components versus entire systems. So we'll have to watch it. Obviously as you get into the higher SEER units you're probably going to be looking at more system-level changes. And then as we get into 2025 with a new refrigerant probably more system-level changes. So -- it's something we watch but we've seen no evidence of.While the underlying trends remain strong our backlog is up in commercial up of 30%. Orders up mid-teens again. Underlying trends like ABI I think March was at the highest levels we've seen in over a year at 58%. So we'll keep an eye on it. Again we're specifically watching China right now. But a lot of the underlying trends including things like aftermarket and controls continue to be encouraging.Well we'll have to see. What we've sized it at is a few hundred million of overdue to customer demand because of supply chain shortages. And 2/3 of that of our overdue relates to chips. How quickly we recover on that we'll have to see. And then how much is this year and how much goes into next year we're going to have to see if it's a fluid situation Brett. But I can tell you that our team I believe is working all the right things frankly working around the clock in a very very challenging environment. And it's not just chips it's logistics. Some of the input material continues to be challenging. But at the same time I do think our team is doing the right things. The key for I think the entire industry is chip capacity coming online as soon as possible. And some of the logistics dysfunctionality getting improved.No. I mean it's been positive. Commercial Fire was up 20% plus. Industrial Fire is doing very well as POG comes kind of back. Residential Fire did very well. The issue that we have to really watch is the Access Solutions piece because they're most reliant on chips. So demand has been strong in the Access Solutions piece we're very well positioned. But the key is that operationally we need more chips online so they can start recovering. And that happens to be quite a high margin business for us.Okay. Well thank you everyone. First thanks to our team here at Carrier our more than 50 000 people globally. Really proud of how the team has started this year and continues to execute despite the headwinds that get thrown our way. So very proud of our team and thanks to all of you for joining. And of course Sam will be available for any follow-up questions.,0.003414941,0.004645705,0.000752096
173,173,ADM,Luciano:,Yes. Oils have been tied for several months already if not the year and of course any announcement in the proximity also of the largest producer of palm oil in the world rattles the markets. Of course it was immediately clarified that this doesn't include crude palm oil which is the biggest product. So I would say I think Indonesia is just trying to take a short-term palliative for their domestic inflation. I don't think it will significantly alter the global balances. Although the global balance is continue to be very tight and any disruption we have the Ukrainian disruption of course with and the Russian with sunflower oil so this is an area that everybody has to pay a lot of attention and it will require companies like ADM to having the ability to reformulate so we can take some customers that our existing customers or either palm oil or sunflower oil to have alternatives to continue to supply their customers. So we are seeing that through our Olenex joint venture we're seeing that through our Stratas joint venture. So as weâ€™ve seen the opportunity to add a lot of value to some of the customers that are looking for replacements at this point in time.Sure. Yes Rob. As I said I think that we have very strong visibility of course into Q2. I would say further than that I think customers â€“ the markets are inverted. So customers see prices relatively high right now those customers that are not covered they feel like maybe the course is showing them that they can get covered later at the cheaper rate than today. So I would say in general we have coverage for the next quarter not for Q3 or Q4. But when we look at the demand that we are seeing around the world we think that when you think about meal and oil in general not only North America but also Brazil. The crush margins need to be there to encourage the crushers to crush. We need the demand for oil and we need the soybean meal. So you will have to have the demand the crush margins to incentivate people to crush. And we are seeing that with the margins that are happening in Brazil or the U.S. or Europe all our margins today are higher than what we anticipated. And we think that that's the year rollout and demand continues to be solid out there and strong crush margins will continue to send that signal to all of our crushers which is we need the meal we need the oil keep crushing.Rob we have â€“ as part of our global trade group we have a strong ocean freight group and they work hand in glove to make sure that we continue to serve the customers with the most effective destinations the most efficient destinations. So we are a big player. And as a big player with a lot of resources we tend to have a relative advantage to others. So when things get complicated and right now they are very complicated. We tend to have a relative higher competitive advantage than others. So I think that shows in the margins that we obtained in this. And logistics right now are complicated. They are complicated in the river. They are complicated in the oceans and there is a lot of redrawing of trade flows and you can only redraw a lot of trade flows if you have a lot of origin options and a lot of destination options because you need to connect both. And our ocean freight group counts with that blessing which is ADM originating all the key parts of the world. I have destination units in all key parts of the world. So it provides them with more ability to play supply routes than maybe other players.Yes. Listen we are paying of course close attention to that. At this point in time we haven't seen any significant impact on demand for us. If you think about so far customers are paying higher prices but they still especially in North America they still haven't changed their behaviors. We think that of course if you have disposable income suffering from higher gas prices and higher food prices eventually they will have to adjust. We have seen more to be honest Vincent in the â€“ some of the emerging markets in which may be food is a bigger percentage of their disposable income. So we have seen some adjustments a small adjustment in that. But I would say at this point in time we have not seen any relevant or material adjustment to our demand. And we think that given the pent-up demand that existed from recovery of the coming out of COVID people in general have been â€“ having higher saving rates. And we have seen wage inflation around the world that have gotten more money in the pockets of many. So at this point in time we think consumer has been and demand has been very resilient. But thereâ€™s going to be a point in which disposable income will get tight and we will see some changes into that. We havenâ€™t seen it yet. We donâ€™t see it in the immediate future either.Yes. Listen Michael we havenâ€™t seen at this point in time any significant impact to our poultry demand in North America. The numbers at this point in time seems to be about half the size of the issue that was in 2015. So itâ€™s something we are following very closely. Of course but we cannot say that we have an impact so far. And hopefully this virus are difficult to control. So of course there is a lot of sanitary elements being thrown at that hopefully that will placate. But we will have to keep a close eye to them.Yes. On fertilizers to be honest Michael of course fertilizer supply chains are tight and itâ€™s been highly publicized. However our evidence shows that trade lanes are adopting and markets are getting sufficient supplies of fertilizer. Of course we had much higher prices that will drive prices for grain. I think today especially Brazil â€“ the U.S. certainly have the fertilizer for this crop. So the question is the Brazilian crop which is coming in a few months. And I think it is still possible what we get from our people in Brazil to get enough potassium fertilizer in country by the planting season. And of course any shortages can produce production losses. But at this point in time when people are thinking between maybe 15% or 20% less application at that level we donâ€™t think that weâ€™re going to see a significant change in the production forecast. It is probably more depending on the weather at this point in time and rain than fertilizer application. And the second was on food versus fuel. At this point in time I think that we are committed to try to help the world with food and the environment. So theyâ€™re both axis of the same equation. I would say they both touch disposable income that I was saying before if you get ethanol to reduce the cost of gasoline that creates more disposable income to take on food inflation. If you take â€“ if you donâ€™t put any biofuels into gasoline and you pay more for gasoline then you may get cheaper food but you have less disposable income there. So to be honest I think the molecules react to the prices that they are given in the market given the different regulations and the different values. Well we try to be as efficient as possible bring in as much of those â€“ as many of those molecules to the market as possible to satisfy everybody. So I think at this point in time we have seen some corrections in certain biofuels mandates across the world. But in other countries it has been only a reduction and not an elimination. So this â€“ I think they are short-term things because we still have the climate crisis which is a long-term objective that mostly the transportation industry but also every industry will have to address biofuels sustainable aviation fuels and all that are a big part of that reduction.Yes. Thank you Eric. Let me see â€“ let me tell you how I see this. So last year was a big production year and the world needed to consume more grain than that big production. So the issue is the world continues to grow and sometimes itâ€™s not a matter of population growth but itâ€™s a matter of income. And how people like â€“ people in China has been an incredible economic improvement of their standards on living that improve their diet that doesnâ€™t go down. So we think thatâ€™s where we keep on talking about our trend of food security. We will have to provide more for the world. In situations like today where we are already tight from a supply demand perspective and we will get tighter as demand continues to grow. We see here in ADM that at least we need two very good seasons of crops in North America and South America to actually balance and become more comfortable in those supply-demand balances. When we think about prices today prices today are going up to mark three things that needs to happen. One is export prices need to go up to being able to draw out all the inventories that are stuck there or they are safe they are hoarded there to be able to replace the production that we have lost. The production we have lost in South America but the production we are losing now in the Ukraine and Russia. So first you need to draw out those inventories and bring them into market. So we can balance ourselves. The second as I said before wheat needs to be placed out of the Russians. So you can be preserved for human consumption. And the third one is to give farmers like you the signal that they need to plant more and I think the world need more acres. Those acres today they are not going to happen from the Baltic area they are not going to happen from U.S. that we are basically maxed out. So they may happen in South America. So we need higher prices to bring South American acres we need higher prices to draw those inventories into the market. And we need two good years of crops both in North America and South America. That will allow us to balance the supply demand given the strong demand.Eric Iâ€™m not an economist. But I think there is a narrow path to achieve a soft landing here. And the U.S. economy has been very resilient through all this events. So I think the U.S. economy is driven by the consumer. The consumer has been saving money for two years that they didnâ€™t spend a lot. And as I said before they were COVID recovery packages. But there is also been salary inflations and wages inflation that has put money in the pockets of customers. So I think that for the foreseeable future we donâ€™t see a significant impact of demand. If not we will be flagging that out but we look at that we look at our plans we are preparing our plans for a long period of the strong demand. We want to run them at high capacity. So at this point in time I donâ€™t see an issue in the west maybe the only flag is how COVID lockdowns evolve in China. But that I donâ€™t have a lot of visibility at this point in time.Thank you Eric.Thank you Emily. Before we close our call I wanted to take a minute to thank Ray for his exceptional contribution all this year to ADMâ€™s as our CFO. So thank you Ray. And itâ€™s been a pleasure and Iâ€™m delighted that you continue with us to continue to help take ADMâ€™s a bigger player.Thank you and congratulations Ray.

174,174,MRNA,Bancel:,Thanks Stephen. Good morning Salveen. Itâ€™s Stephane. So as you know in term of capital allocation our priority number one is to invest in the business. We believe we have this really unique platform that is very different from typical pharma companies or biotech companies where we have an ability to scale very quickly. As we discussed today we are actively preparing the pivotal studies and the launch of four programs in Phase 3 as we discussed. As you know thereâ€™s a lot of programs in Phase 2. And I think thereâ€™s around 30 vaccines in development today. And Stephen has showed you today that we believe we have built for our platform and all our investment in digital and a great team we have the ability in around 12 months to go from opening an IND in vaccine to starting the Phase 3. So seeing where the pipeline is and where itâ€™s going to be 12 months 24 months from now that is really exciting. And then thereâ€™s therapeutics. We always get a question around COVID-19 for obvious reasons. But as weâ€™ve said in our remarks this year will be very exciting around therapeutics. We have two rare genetic disease programs that are well recruiting as Stephen described for which we are eager when we have it to share data with you. And assuming this is positive we will do more in rare genetic disease. As youâ€™ll recall because youâ€™ve been following the Company for a long time we started with a few infectious vaccines and as we got more confirmation that the technology was working in human and more recently more capital we had a very unprecedented acceleration of our infectious disease vaccine. Well we plan to do the same in rare genetic diseases if we get positive clinical data and personalized cancer vaccines. And as you know we have as Stephen said more cancer programs autoimmune programs and also quite exciting to work with our partner Vertex toward getting following application the CF mRNA candidate into the clinic. In terms of M&A I can tell you our teams have never been as busy. They are looking at a lot of opportunities literally across the world across therapeutic area but also technologies. And so we will not be shy to invest to expand the platform have approved technology or approved product and thatâ€™s really where we are in terms of M&A. So more to come when things get finalized and signed. And as you know the third bucket of our priorities in terms of balance sheet is returning shareholders to capital via share buyback. And so this as David said weâ€™ll continue to buy back share at attractive prices. And weâ€™ll continue to have a dialogue with the Board as to what should we do after the current plan if needed. But now weâ€™re focused on executing the current plan. Thank you.Yes. And maybe just to add Gena itâ€™s Stephane on the pricing. As David said as we move into endemic as weâ€™ve been saying weâ€™ll have to discuss with payers as part of kind of health economics and value of products as itâ€™s done for every pharmaceutical product especially in the U.S. And as you might be aware CMS has already communicated that for fiscal year 2023 which starts in October 2022 the reimbursement for COVID-19 vaccine is going to be $60.Goodâ€¦Go ahead David. You take the first one and then Iâ€™ll comment on the...And just to comment on the number of individuals who we think are at high risk. Clearly it can change as we see the vaccine -- weâ€™ve seen with the epidemiology of the virus as Stephen commented earlier. But just going back to our Vaccines Day earlier we think that that high-risk population is somewhere in the range of about 1.7 billion people worldwide.Sure. Tiffany this is Stephane. So indeed while we are in discussion with the U.S. government as you would assume is appropriate. Weâ€™re also working toward assuming that thereâ€™s no government order -- or American order for vaccines. We want to make sure we can protect as many Americans as we can on vaccine. And so with our commercial U.S. team weâ€™re working very diligently and David and I have spent quite some time in the last weeks and months to make sure that we have all the wholesaler contracts and all the pieces you need to be able to be commercial in the traditional sense of the world in vaccine. And we have quite a number of executives that are vaccine self experienced in the U.S. on our team. And so while we hope that the U.S. government like other countries in the world will decide to place an order like theyâ€™ve done in the past to allow the maximum number people including people uninsured to get vaccinated weâ€™re getting fully ready assuming the day zero order from the U.S. government just in case if that happens. This is a 100% private market in the fall and the Company will be ready for that.Yes. So this is Stephane. Partnership versus M&A I think itâ€™s really a question of risk and then willingness of sellers to sell because it needs be two to tango. And so as weâ€™ve done from the effort we met at Metagenomi what we do a partnership in terms of licensing for Metagenomi is because we are very excited about the science and the team that we discovered over time and with diligence. We thought at this stage of the gene editing technology of that company it was not the best thing for us to do from a risk-adjusted basis to acquire the company. And in terms of M&A we would be very happy to buy the right company that we really believe will drive value to Moderna on commercial basis. In terms of deal size weâ€™re looking at a lot of different things. But again we are staying very-disciplined. We are here to create value not to do things just for the sake of doing things. As you know a lot of us own a significant share in the Company and we are already focused on creating value. So the BD team as I said is most busy they have been in a long time. Weâ€™re looking at a lot of things literally around the world because the best science is not always in this country. Thereâ€™s a lot of amazing science in this country but thereâ€™s a lot of other smart people around the planet. And we think with Modernaâ€™s infrastructure and capital actually has a lot of technology that we could potentially scale up where thereâ€™s commercial teams that have cool science but not necessarily the right balance sheet and infrastructure to scale and to maximize patient impact. Stephen do you want to take RSV?Well thank you very much for joining us today. We look forward to meeting a lot of you in person in Boston when we do the R&D Day two weeks from now. Have a great day. Thanks.,0.265174429,0.788044095,0.369725022
175,175,PCAR,Feight:,Well I mean obviously it's a competitive market out there. We've done a team has done a really good job of increasing the prices as costs have gone up and we've had some good realization over the few quarters here largely is driven by the need for these parts and the fact that we are connected with the customer numbers more and more right? Trucks are getting complicated. We have sophisticated customers and the interaction between PACCAR our dealers and our customers is a real contributor to growth as well as more proprietary content like engines like our PACCAR transmissions PACCAR axles. All of this is just helping us flow through a connected position to our customers. So that will continue and that's great for the future.Sure. I'll take that one and just kind of think of it this way we've just come through a couple of years where we've not been able to build the number of trucks we need as an industry. We've had really strong freight volumes. People are running their trucks out there putting miles on them. They have an operating model which says they either want their fleet age to be two years or three years or whatever it is. And they've exceeded that by 10% or 15%. And they're probably not going to adjust that business model which is successful for them. So they're going to want to draw down that age of fleet as they can and that's going to take some time. As the supply base remains constrained we expect to see these improvements in our deliveries but they're not going to be just for a quarter. We expect to see this to be a good period of time for PACCAR in the industry.Yes. Sure Ross. I mean I think that it's a fair question. If you think of spot rates they're really the fringe of the business. They're not the foundation of the business. And so I think people may want to use them as a leading indicator but they shouldn't think of them as systemically covering what freight is doing out there. And so since there is strong business out there even if spot rates decline a little bit they're still present and the fixed contracts are still really strong. So as long as that continues it bodes well for the market.Well it's funny that you haven't asked that question a while. I would simply say the way we look at it is the business is doing fantastic. PACCAR continues to grow. We expect to keep growing and we always are looking around the world for the best things for our shareholders. And I think that's as much as we can say right now.You bet.Sure. I think you nailed it. It's a timing issue in the year. So we still hold that $350 million to $400 million in the full year with $78 million in the in the first quarter. So it's a run rate for new technologies some pretty fun projects that we have that we're spinning up that will help us in the future.I mean as a general sense you can say that they've declined right? We had -- about a year ago we were coming into the strong used truck market. So there was used inventory out there. And obviously now with the strong freight demand people are holding on to those units so they're just not coming into the inventory of our dealers or our used truck centers. So it's at a lower level. And that's likely to continue for a while. So as far as a specific number to think of it in terms of months and still think of it as less than two months of inventory out there.You bet.Good morning.Yes. I would think of it if you're saying macroscopic I would think of it in terms of each year is its own circumstance and that the model can be disrupted by any number of factors. But I don't think that the general expectation of the fleet is changing much. They want to maintain a fleet age at a certain level. And when they get beyond that then they want to replace it. Obviously there's slight nuances to cycle timing but they're their freight volume is strong. And the easiest way for -- as we think about it as their freight volume is strong and they look at the opportunity of owning the great new Kenworth Peterbilt and DAF Trucks and the fact that those are going to yield thousands of dollars per unit in savings we see no reason that won't continue. Nuances beyond that seem less significant.Sure. As we looked at the segment deliveries geographic deliveries I would say that North America we just saw that we had in the medium-duty market actually some impact to the supply base there which kind of constrained North American medium-duty deliveries and that was probably what weighed in the first quarter. And hope we'll see some reconciliation there in the second quarter of that. And I'd say from an industry standpoint our guidance is just we tightened it up a little bit and we tightened it up to move the midpoint up because the market still feels really strong to us. So in that view is where we saw ourselves sitting.And the only add to what I'd give is if these trucks are not just good for their pocketbook but their drivers which is such a key element of their business right now. There's no truck they'd rather be in than the new DAF the new Peterbilt the new Kenworth. I was at a truck stop a week ago and at the fuel island talking somebody who had a new PACCAR product and they were just beside themselves with the way this truck looks and drives down think it's important to realize that the drivers have a big play here and PACCAR products are where people want to be.Sure. Understood. And when we make investments and big capital investments we do it to be more efficient and we strive for that. So yeah there's some of that in there as well.Well I would say -- let me take the back half of your question. So -- yeah we think 2023 could be a good year. It's pretty far out but we think it could be a really good year. As far as comments on pre-buy we think that conversation is overdone. I think that there's a lot of great new products in the market out there. There's not a substantial change going into the general US market in terms of technologies. There will be some improvements in CO2 reductions or fuel economy again which can cause some people to want to buy earlier some people don't want to wait for those improvements. So I think that it's really mostly California impact in terms of what might happen in terms of real tech change. So I wouldn't overweight that in my thoughts of 2023.Well what I would think of it as is we have a strong order backlog to substantially full. So if you place an order for a truck today you might be able to get it in the fourth quarter but it's starting to slide out and that's why the orders have been limited is because we're not ready to open up fully the 2023 order board because of the uncertainties of what the parts supply is going to be and the cost structure is going to be. And so that's how we look at it.You're absolutely right that in fact is what's happening.You bet.Harrie?Well we look forward to seeing you in person. That's going to be fun. And I think it's going to be a little bit more information about how the business is doing what the future looks like for us and the strength of PACCAR going forward and how that's going to just accelerate. So we look forward to seeing everybody there.All right.,0.004382834,0.006782234,0.001746882
176,176,IDXX,Mazelsky:,Yes. Chris let me try to address your question from a context standpoint both from the standpoint of capacity or supply and then I want to talk a bit about the pet owner dynamics and demand. So all the surveys and all the conversations we've had with veterinarians indicate a good deal of optimism about the future and it includes 2022 in terms of growth and their prospects. Their focus is really I think pivoted. The pandemic has only accelerated the pivot towards being able to provide excellent medical services and patient care as well as a pleasing client experience. So relatively less emphasis on things like product sales specialty diets. They're also seeing from a pet owner standpoint demanding clients who really want full-service care. So speaking with a number of veterinarians just yesterday they remarked when pet owners come in are still looking to really have sort of an end-to-end approach to care. So I talked about that strong pivot. And if anything the pandemic I think has only accelerated that. And they know that the diagnostics plays a key role in being able to guide care services and the whole clinical envelope. And to Brian's point at the same time there's been a very significant step-up in activity both in terms of number of patients. There's 10-plus percent more pets relative to pre-pandemic 10-plus percent higher clinical visits. And the practices themselves they haven't been immune to some of the labor and staff challenges that to some extent all businesses are facing. So they're working through that dynamic of higher activity while trying to create some balance and looking to increase capacity. And they're looking at us in many respects and have this large appetite for things like IDEXX instrumentation. We saw that manifest itself in higher sales cloud-based software solutions. I think it's both indicative of their optimism for the future and recognizing that if they have better tools that can support both staff productivity and higher standards of care. Let me pivot and talk a bit about pet owner dynamics because I think that addresses your question how this is going to play out over time. By all accounts we think pet owner demand remains very strong. We all know there's a very strong human-animal bond. And by all accounts all the data we look at that continues to grow. We also know that from a spending power standpoint just as a percent of discretionary spend that they're spending all in on pets across all economic and demographic cohorts still under 2%. And the medical services piece much smaller than that. So pet owners they consistently indicate not just in surveys but in actual behavior that they prioritize spend on veterinary care sometimes even to the extent that about a quarter or so that they would spend first on their pet before their own health care. But they prioritize consistently across much larger groups relative to things like entertainment and travel and going out to dinner. And that's even more pronounced in the younger generations like Generation Z and Millennials. So getting back to -- we know there's been a significant number of adoptions to the pandemic 10-plus percent over the last couple of years. We look at things like surrenders and we don't see any real movement from that baseline. In fact what the survey say is that first-time pet owners are looking to actually adopt potentially a second pet in some appreciable numbers. From a headwind standpoint we know there's some overlays like working from home and companies returning more to a sort of a hybrid-type model. But we think that that still gives the pet owners the flexibility to be able to take their dog or cat to the veterinarian. So we're keeping an eye on these trends. But I think on a net basis we think pet-owner demand remains strong.Yes. And I would just add to that though clinical visits it's been an important part of our growth algorithm but it's just one part. The other thing to keep in mind is the diagnostics adoption and the utilization piece of the business is very strong. We've highlighted that in the earnings highlight where adoption and utilization is at or higher than what we've seen from the pre-pandemic level. So from a customer engagement standpoint I think we have a pretty well-defined playbook. It's really been honed and optimized over the years to be able to drive and inspire diagnostics adoption and utilization both through creating awareness and education and ultimately trialing. But also innovation and continuing to bring innovation that solves the challenging practice and patient problems. So we're optimistic about our ability to continue to do that and do that in an effective way.Yes. Erin just in terms of the resilience of the business. If you go back to the Great Recession and the recovery in 2008 2009 our revenue grew 5%. Now a lot has changed over that 10-plus years and I think from a very positive standpoint. We worked through other channels third-party distributor channels. We now have our own direct channel and direct relationships with customers. We know that the human animal bond and the strengthening of the bond has suddenly increased and increased very appreciably. Obviously there's a lot more pets. And our innovation portfolio both across the reference labs and our point-of-care diagnostics portfolio and very importantly in this environment software has gotten I think appreciably stronger and more capable not just in the U.S. but globally. So we think we're a very resilient business that has become even more resilient as a result of those factors.Yes. Jon it's Jay. So keep in mind that's from -- that 0.5% which is more of the pre-pandemic historical norm is from a much higher base. So we're building off that 3% base that we saw in Q1 of 2021. And so we both look at -- to the extent that clinical visits include diagnostics we want to be able to continue to grow that and we have seen nice growth in this year of that higher base as well as then when they do use it are they using more from a volume and dollar standpoint. And that's 8% which includes some price effect there. So we think that is very healthy in terms of how veterinarians see the use of diagnostics as an enabler to the broader medical services envelope.Yes. Just specifically around your comment relative to curb side drop off and pick up. We see practices even though we've I think transitioned from the pandemic to the endemic business continue that in -- I mean it's in the minority of cases probably 15-plus -- they like that from the standpoint of supporting the productivity of the practice a lot of pet owners like that. I think practices have adopted some level of concierge service around that type of thing. So I don't think that that's going to go away. It will probably continue to remain a smaller part of that whole. Certainly it's a step down from sort of the peak of the pandemic but it's still there to some extent.Nathan I think it's a bit of all of the above. From the standpoint of -- so there's clearly a much higher level of activity that they're adapting to and we've talked about the staff shortages. And I think there are some staff out just related COVID even though it's not resulting in hospitalizations. Normally when people get COVID they have to spend some time at home. But there's a number of I think proactive things that practices are doing including investing in technology. We see just a very significant appetite for software and the productivity that the software can deliver both from the standpoint of staff productivity as well as really being able to enable standard of care. And our solutions whether it's the ezyVet solution or clinical decision support because that's part VetConnect PLUS is an important part of that. Also instrumentation and the growth that we're seeing in premium instrumentation it's really -- it's been very significant 31% increase in growth in placements 14% increase in our premium installed base. I think that's reflective of practice owners and veterinarians recognizing that they need to have the latest technology. In other cases I think practices are looking at staffing mix and staffing formulas and recognizing that they can increase the number of vet techs and in some cases non-licensed vet techs at higher ratios than they have right now and that can generate higher revenues they had higher pet owner client support relative to their current baselines. So really looking at a broad range of practices to be able to increase capacity.Yes. So I'll talk about this the opportunity. In addition to what I mentioned from a software in a clinic standpoint our reference laboratory solutions testing solutions platform really serve as an extension of the practice. So insofar as practices maybe get strained or they want to send out testing and even our medical services. So we have a very large group of pathologists and boarded some radiologists and internal medicine specialists they can do that. So we think that that is a net positive in terms of being able to support the practices and continues to open up opportunity to that effect.Okay. And with that I'd like to thank everybody on the phone for their participation this morning and to the IDEXX employees listening. I'd like to say thank you for your continued devotion to our purpose and enduring focus on delivering today. Your unwavering support and engagement enable us to continuously execute at a very high level and support our customers despite unpredictable and evolving dynamics in our sector and around the world. We're thankful for your excellent efforts and look forward to continuing our strong momentum through the rest of '22. And so with that we'll conclude the call and thank you.,0.002814472,0.003225029,0.000248534
177,177,IQV,Bousbib:,"Okay. Well look real world evidence we saw strong growth. You saw that in TAS in general organic constant currency revenue growth excluding COVID was just over 10% in aggregate. And the high growth segments as you pointed out are real world evidence and of course as you all know Commercial Tech which continued to be strong drivers of growth. And I gave several examples specific client examples of how in the commercial world and technology space and real world evidence we are utilizing our unique capabilities. So real world evidence is doing disclose the numbers here or not?Yes exactly John. We see that continuing. To your last question with respect to that COVID step down in revenue which we've been talking about for a while now we've always said during the height of the pandemic that and this is true for real world is true for commercial and certainly is extremely true for the R&DS business. COVID work essentially crowded out the rest of the business because our clients understandably refocused their dollars on COVID whether it's vaccines or therapeutics or what have you. But on the commercial side government works to track and monitor COVID patients et cetera and they turned to us. As you know we had a very strong share of that market appropriately. And the concerns that some of you had expressed at that time is well when that goes away then what happens? Well we told you that that time that when that would go away the base business would come back because we knew that there were a lot of projects that have been essentially put on hold and that there was a lot of pent up demand that needed to be addressed and that's exactly what is happening. Exactly what is happening. Now that's true with real world evidence it's true on the commercial side and it is true certainly in R&DS. Thank you.Well look we always said we've gave guidance we have done and that's been consistent. By the way you can look at our record is between 1 and 2 points of our revenue top line growth over the long-term has been supplementing our organic growth. We make acquisitions within our core businesses when they are strategic and add capabilities or allow us to enter adjacent markets where we think we can add value. We have walked away we do walk away from I want to say 90 plus percent of the companies we look at in the market. We always felt that valuations were very frothy and that we did not want to despite the rate environment so long we did not want to pay for assets more than what they were worth. And unfortunately for those who did you now find yourself in an environment where valuations have taken a beating and now you've got a lot of private equity owned businesses that are very attractive we would like to buy. But the entry points for those current owners at the time we did the acquisition was very high. And so I just don't know how that -- it's going to take time. And because of that I am suggesting that we are going to -- if we were always cautious we are going to continue to be cautious now. Having said that we will step up to the plate when the acquisition is extremely attractive extremely accretive to our operations and our financials and we've done that in the quarter actually we bought significant lab business which is very attractive. And I believe that's the bulk of our acquisition spending that and correct yes. And we like very much the lab business as we discussed before. These are very strong and necessary capabilities and our lab business has been doing spectacular. We obviously we look at CROs when they come up but again the valuation premiums on those assets have been out of reach for us. On the commercial side we've bought technology companies and we will continue to look at the digital space. We've got as you know a strong interest in growing in continue to grow on the commercial side the commercial side is becoming increasingly sophisticated with the go to market strategies of our clients becoming a lot more akin to how larger consumer oriented businesses look at the world with much better you see what our OCE suite how our OCE ecosystem does with a lot of embedded intelligence is no longer -- we're not talking about a simple CRM point solution as is the case for most of the competition our system is an ongoing live with sophisticated AI analytics that enable the users to make decisions on a timely basis with respect to targeting the right customer at the right time with the right message. And so anything that complements or advances our position in the U.S. digital and European digital commercial spaces where it's most advanced we will look at and we will be aggressive enough to enter those spaces and complement our capabilities. So that's what you know I just gave you my overall strategic panorama here in terms of acquisitions.Well first of all I -- capacity we always is people driven in this business as you know. But I would say if anything certainly seems to merger. Our ability to take on more work with the same amount of people has increased significantly because of our decentralized clinical trials capabilities. The increase in technology content in data analytics in process improvements that we've done since the merger is very dramatic. So our ability to take on more work with the same amount of people is significantly enhanced. So I don't see frankly our turning away work because somehow we don't have the capacity we just don't do that. Again with the minor exception of what I described before in my introductory comments for pre-commercial EBPs that knock at our door for assistance and that don't qualify based on our rigorous vetting process. With that minor exception we are able willing eager to take on any and all work. So certainly I hope we continue assuming the underlying dynamics of the market continue to grow which is I think a very very valid assumption and a completely conservative expectation. And assuming that we continue to gain market share which is also I think a conservative expectation. You should expect our bookings to continue to grow over the long-term no question about it.Thank you.Look I don't know I'm not going to speak for other competitors. I obviously people in the industry know or have knowledge of what their peers focus on in terms of market segments. Look from the beginning of this merger we said we were going to be a lot more thorough in terms of what gets into our backlog. If you recall we switched from """"awarded business"""" to """"contracted business"""" we became a lot more vigorous in terms of the specific booking analytics. I mean again I want to I certainly hope you will never ever hear from us God forbid it that we are making an adjustment to our bookings because we are the some kind of some meteorites came from the cosmos and hit our backlog. You haven't heard that from us quite the opposite. And so we tell you what the numbers are and those numbers are thoroughly and vigorously scrubbed. I repeat we're not going to take it. There are many we deal with our many clients that call or companies that call or [indiscernible] firms or they are lot of -- these are lot of biotech staff all over the world with high hopes and they'd love to have us help them and support them and they sometimes even want to leverage the fact that they are supported by a few IQVIA in order to raise money. And of course we just don't do that. That's not our business. You know that could be -- you know it is often the case that an EBP at a very early stage with one molecules and high hopes and a nice looking management team go around raising money and they come in with at least an assertion that there is a CRO already involved and that has vetted their -- the scientific basis et cetera. And the more credible the CRO the better chances they have of raising money. Now we don't do that. It is simple. Others do. So that there are significant differences between how we do business. Someone asked earlier about capacity. And I said this is not going to be a capacity issue for us. But look it's not that we are desperate for business we have business so we're not going to take on anyone. So I think that may be one difference. And as we said market segment focus you have Mike do you have any other comment?Thank you and very important.And then your first comment frankly was the right one which is it's a very small part of our overall business our company.Yes yes of course. But again it's a small small piece of the overall and we are absorbing that cost. So we haven't changed our profit outlook and we are not planning to do that for now. There's no reason to do that. We can absorb it. We have enough initiatives. We are large enough diversified enough that we can handle the Russia Ukraine situation and disruption on clinical trials normal so longer that's what that it is what it is now. Okay?",0.002814278,0.003289938,0.000340672
178,178,NUE,Topalian:,Yes. Maybe I'll jump in first and then Rex on the sheet side and Doug if there's anything you want to add on the raw materials side. But Timna typically we're in that 75% contract rate on our sheet group. So that's the highest contract rate we have in any of our product groups. The sheet demand has been again through '21 was unlike anything I've seen in my 25 years. To your point as we entered 2022 we did see some softening. So softening on pricing which really drove some of the late Q3 early Q4 import buys that you saw and then we're seeing now really come into the U.S. market where the delta between hot-rolled coil in the U.S. and the rest of the world was way too high. Again that recovered or more equalized in the early part of '22. And again as we maintain our market perspective and how we wanted to serve this market as Rex and both Allen have played their share we didn't go out and chase the spot tons. We didn't want to just simply look to bringing tons in if our profitability was going to be impacted. And we just made some other decisions as we looked at the quarter A not thinking about market share but also to look at how do we balance that approach moving forward. So to answer your question as we've looked through that Q2 is going to increase profitability. And why we stated already we believe that's going to be a record is largely because of the recovery and how quickly the sheet pricing is going to move through into the order book of Nucor or the bottom line of Nucor. And that's going to happen again in weeks instead of months. And again over the years and in conversations with you there's been times that lag has been way too long. And again you're going to see a very quick recovery. The other thing you look at in Q1 is our breakdown of EBITDA per ton. Our EBITDA per ton we maximize that value. And I think that's going to reflect very strongly against our competition and again flows through to our bottom line for our shareholders. Rex anything you'd add on the sheet side?And last point Timna is as we've seen throughout the years and decades when scrap prices are really high so are steel prices. And again that's what you're seeing today and that's reflecting in the bottom line.Yes. No it definitely was demand. Demand definitely dropped off in Q1 as we saw a softening in the sheet market. So yes it was not the same environment we saw in Q3 or 4 of '21 at all. Again pricing was dropping. I think there was some wondering in the market how long how protractive what would that be? And it was a great time for Nucor to capitalize on the maintenance outages that we delayed in many of our sheet mills and get caught up. And again as pointed out earlier not to chase tons. And so we didn't do that. And again a very deliberate mindset on our part to do that. The other piece of that is in the distribution side as those -- that supply chain side of distribution was full and they didn't enter the market nearly as aggressively as we would have typically seen in years gone by and the early part of January or February time frame trying to understand what the market was going to do longer term into the back half of Q1 into Q2. I think again that pivot came very quickly and those tons are back and flowing. And so I think you're going to see -- well I know you're going to see a significant increase in utilization rates across both our sheet and plate groups.Yes. Great questions. I'm going to turn it to Rex Query and Al Behr to give you a more detailed update on Gallatin and Brandenburg.Yes. Certainly Seth. I'll ask Chad Utermark to comment on that. Just as a backdrop the performance of our products groups has been spectacular. And again I couldn't be more proud of how they responded again in what they've done and how they've achieved. And we expect continued great things and improving things as they head throughout the year. But Chad do you want to provide a little more detail on the products?And Curt you mentioned longs. I'll just provide a very quick comment on longs. If you think about the 10-year history like our beam mill for example probably averaged 70% utilization over the last decade. As we entered in 2021 that increased over 90%. And so that beam mill and that market leadership position we have in structurals creates an incredible earning power. And again that demand and those drivers remain very strong both in beams and rebar and most of our longs businesses that are generating incredible returns for our company.Look as we continue to again set the first quarter record as we set record earnings in 2021 at over $6 billion of earnings we're continually looking for ways to deploy that capital. As Steve laid out earlier in his comments about our capital allocation framework and philosophy it is first to reinvest in growth and we're going to do that in a multitude of ways. Our mission statement is 8 words: it's grow the core expand beyond and live our culture. The core being those core assets. So yes you're going to see us continue to do things like the micro mill like the West Virginia plant like the expansion at Crawfordsville. Then on the expand beyond piece like the Cornerstone acquisition of the insulated metal panel building or Hannibal Industries and bringing on the racking those things will continue to be great opportunities for Nucor to continue to diversify and grow our portfolio. And then there's a whole bunch of irons in the fire Curt that I can't talk about that we're going to continue to look and bring and maximize shareholder value that we're really excited about.Thank you. As we conclude the call today I just want to thank our team for your continued focus and delivering on our most important value the safety health and well-being of all 30 000 men and women who make up the Nucor family. To our customers thank you. Thank you for the trust that you place in the Nucor team with every order. Our investment strategy is to build the capabilities to serve you today and well into the future. And finally to our shareholders thank you for the trust that you place in us with your valuable shareholder capital. We look to steward that well maximizing your returns. Thank you for your interest in Nucor and have a great day.,0.003474673,0.004316926,0.000596784
179,179,YUM,Turner:,Yes. Thanks John. On the profit side we feel really good with the profit plan for the year. We laid out the shape on our last call. We said the first half was going to be roughly flat. Of course we now have a Russia impact. I think that was one point in Q1. And of course if you think about the lost profit growth in Russia that actually gets you closer to a couple of points. And as you mentioned the China impact. As you heard on their call the business there is softer than expected so that's had a bit of an impact. And we expect that going into Q2 as well. But -- so Q2 is going to land about where Q1 is. But those are the two primary drivers. And of course when we think about the full year we still think Russia is the one driver that takes us off of our algorithm from a profit standpoint for the year. Of course we're going to work hard to try to overdeliver against that plan. So in general we feel really good about the profit plan with a little bit of noise there on those two factors. In terms of development we feel great about the pipeline. Our Q1 was strong but the pipeline looking to the rest of the year remains strong as well. And of course it's our job every day to come in and find ways to overdeliver against that 4% to 5% unit guidance. Of course keep in mind we had 100 net new units from Russia last year. Even without the 100 net new units we still feel good about delivering on that part of the algorithm.Yes. And on the second part around Pizza Hut U.S. and the shift to using third-party delivery as David said earlier we still see strong demand in the Pizza Hut U.S. business but it's primarily a challenge of being able to fulfill it with the labor challenges around drivers in particular. That's the most pronounced challenge that we have from a labor perspective in the U.S. So that's part of the driver for continuing to shift to additional modes of being able to deliver. And we're doing that by adding in both delivery as a service which is basically still having sales through our website and apps but then fulfillment leveraging those third-party drivers during peak periods when we need extra capacity to help us address some of those hiring challenges for drivers. But as we mentioned we're also working with the aggregator partners on the marketplaces. And that's just part of our strategy for wanting to be ubiquitous be everywhere that our company -- our customers want to do business with us. And we're seeing in the early going on that incremental growth from those channels. In fact we've got one of our leading franchisees who has already moved on to those platforms and is running 4 points or so ahead of the system which is primarily driven by the incremental customers that they're finding on those platforms. And of course the way we negotiate the economics in those deals in the U.S. we really are indifferent in terms of where the sales fall. We ensure that our economics are roughly the same across channels. So we want to be there wherever our customers want to do business with us.Yes yes running 4 or 5 points ahead of the system. And the vast majority of that we attribute to the incremental customers that they're finding through the platform.Well in terms of the strategy to address these challenges David Graves and Aaron Powell who are doing a great job dealing with this very dynamic environment those are a couple of key parts of their strategy for dealing with this. And we'll be implementing the delivery as a service as we mentioned in the earlier comments over the next two to three quarters. And then of course the franchisees each have a decision on how to work with aggregators but we do that under our umbrella agreement. And we expect that those kinds of gains continue to show up in the results. Obviously I think more and more are going to be choosing to move in that direction. So the implementation will take a while but it's certainly part of the strategy for dealing with this really dynamic environment.It's still too early to tell. This is something that has just been implemented over the last few months so still too early and still too limited a sample size I think to draw conclusions on a broad basis. But as we said if you look at our business there is this fulfillment challenge. Our carryout business was actually up in the quarter. So the primary challenge was on the delivery business. And so these strategies are directly pointed at that biggest root cause that's getting in the way of being able to serve and fulfill full customer demand.Yes. Thanks David. As with all elements of our algorithm we're always working to find ways to overdeliver. We called out the one primary driver which on profit creates a headwind this year which -- going into Q2 Q3 Q4 we're going to lose 3 points of operating profit plus the planned growth in Russia as we exclude those from the results and direct any profits from Russia towards humanitarian efforts. So that's the big headwind of course. In the early going as we said this China softness is probably a little bigger than expected. I don't know the long-term trajectory there. You would think at some point in the long term China will rebound and that business should see growth. But I'm sure the timing on that is uncertain. If you think about other puts and takes I think emerging market strength. If you look at our 18% same-store sales growth in emerging markets that's a great sign of recovery and a big important part of our business. So that's a place where you might see upside. Of course on the flip side we'll continue to navigate the really dynamic environment around inflation pricing and how those are playing out in each of our markets around the globe. Right now we think we're dealing with those incredibly well. Our scale gives us advantage and gives our franchisees advantage in dealing with those. But -- a very dynamic environment but we feel really good about the overall profit engine of the business.Yes. So Brian good question. Loyalty is becoming an increasingly important part of our business increasingly important part of our digital experience that we provide to customers. More than half of our restaurants around the globe are part of a loyalty program. Taco Bell in the U.S. is a great example of how we're driving excitement through loyalty. That's what we did with the Taco Lover's Pass. And that helps to drive app downloads and people signing up into the program and we continue to see significant growth in membership in that program. Pizza Hut obviously in the U.S. has a large and very impactful loyalty program. And KFC has great loyalty programs in a number of markets around the globe. So we're going to continue to focus on that implementing it in markets where it makes sense. Interesting question. Obviously we thought about it in terms of cross-brand loyalty. Right now we're focused on maximizing the value of our brand-focused loyalty programs. But obviously as our data and analytics capabilities continue to evolve all sorts of possibilities are out there in the future. But for the time being we'll remain focused on brand-specific loyalty programs.,0.016472146,0.056318104,0.023011714
180,180,ON,El-Khoury:,Yes. This is Hassane. We don't see that. We -- I include demand across whether it's direct or through distribution just to make point. Even our distribution customers we have direct contact with them. So we have a quick touch point on the demand. We see that across the board at this point as Thad mentioned. We're holding inventory and maintaining the distribution inventory at a historically low level in order to maintain that visibility and be able to service the demand that we need for all of our customers. So when we make comments about demand we include direct and distribution demand in that and all of them are within the commentary that we set highly constrained and supply is not yet meeting the demand through 2023.Thank you.So to a first order the answer is yes. Our guide is driven by auto and industrial more led by automotive in the second quarter as we see more of the strength. And really the ramps for some of our customers under the LTSAs that we talked about. So it will be about the same growth but led by automotive.Look it's all of the above that you mentioned. So first off it is all led by the price-to-value discrepancies that I keep talking about where we are recalibrating our complete demand across the value of our products. When we do that and as we mix -- we shift more to auto and industrial which drive higher ASP and higher margin that gives us that sustainable margin expansion that we've been seeing. So all of these are both increase in the value of our products and a mix shift more to these increases. That's one. Two we do have net price increases that we've talked about that $200 million that we've exited so far or the $32 million we exited with 22% margin this quarter that is in a favorable pricing environment. So there is pricing increases included in that but that's not sustainable. As we talked about we lost that revenue. We expect another about $300 million in 2022 at dilutive margin. So when we exit that business our margin will have more of an expansion because of it. But that was a net price increase because we're pricing ourselves out of that market. So that's the two buckets you can take a look at it. One is the sustainable bucket that we see forward looking and longer term and the shorter-term bucket that was net increase from where we were historically still dilutive but not sustainable and that will be exited throughout this year and a little bit next year.Sure. I guess the biggest vote of confidence that I the first building is already full and outputting exactly what we expected it to. And I mentioned that in my prepared remarks as far as yield and capacity or how many millimeters of substrate factory does output. So we're on track with all of those metrics. And right now it's no longer about the engineering side or the development. It's more about the manufacturing expansion. We've secured another site. We are on track to quadrupling our output exiting 2022 as far as again the number of furnaces that translate into millimeter height of substrates. High confidence I guess in summary very high confidence. Our CapEx is going there. We're already generating revenue based on that material. So all in all I'm very bullish about the prospect and we're pushing forward supporting -- in order to support our LTSA. So that would be what I would say.Sure. That's a very good question. And obviously I can't comment on what my competitors will do in an environment today or later especially on pricing and so on. The only thing I can't control is what our view of the market is and our view of the pricing environment is. So I'll focus my answer on that. We view this as sustainable because it's driven by value. But I will remind everybody the portion that we acknowledge is not sustainable is on the non-core that we plan on exiting and we price ourselves out of the market. So what does that mean? In the future where demand and supply starts to come in balance we're not going to chase that down. Our competitors may end up hashing it out amongst themselves but you were not going to see onsemi engaging in a pricing down to keep market share. That's not what our company is about. We're going to focus on the value. Our products today that we're focusing on are strategic and our growth are based on value we provide to customers that pricing is stable. I don't see it going anywhere else. And for the rest of the market let them hash it out but we're not going to chase it down.Yeah. Look I didn't break it up specifically as far as growth. But the design win that is fueling that growth was about 33% year-over-year. This is new designs and replacing incumbents further supporting our 11%. So the 11% we talked about you're absolutely right. We do have growth in that other segment and that's driven by the cloud which is key for us from a growth and margin expansion business. Our design wins our revenue today supports a comfortable 11% growth over the next five years.Yes. Look so it's primarily the supply disruption overall. Think about logistics think about getting material in and out of factories and so on. So we're able to mitigate some of that by rerouting but the lack of mobility is what is hard to judge. I don't know what commentary you're referring to on the image sensor. I can't comment on that because that did not come from â€“ from onsemi source. I don't see any specific product impacted versus just like I said the logistics that everybody has been commenting about. That's really their present on the ground. And like we talked about we do see that. We put it into our guide already. So depending on how that loosens up we'll talk about it in the second quarter.Look a lot of the growth in our strategic core is driven by units that we talk about the content because a lot of the price-to-value discrepancy that we talked about that was implemented primarily in 2021. So a lot of the growth moving forward is a lot of it is content. But overall units will be down because a lot of the exits that we've done is low ASP low margin high volume. So we focus our unit to where our strategic focus has been and that's been increasing and I mentioned that in my prepared remarks driven a lot by the content not just per car from apples-to-apples car to car where there's more content whether it's imaging or power but also as we shift more into EVs that have much more content. So from that perspective it's driven by units. The ASP is in the baseline to a first order. And as we ship more of the auto and industrial we're going to benefit from the ASP reset that we've done in throughout 2021 which calls it in my view sustainable as we move forward.Yes. Yes that's a good. So we are getting obviously some increases from foundry and some reducing bottlenecks internally in our manufacturing. But like I said not enough to catch up to the demand. So if I answer the question directly we do see increase in supply through '22 and even '23. But based on where the demand is it's not going to get into balance. And that's where I keep talking about the supply constraint because it's the supply and demand side. Both of them increase demand has increased at a faster rate which keeps us a little bit behind because it takes 18 to 24 months to add capacity these days with all of the lead times and everything. Demand has been increasing. So net-net we're not catching up. But we have been making investments in our CapEx but very specifically on technologies. For example we're not adding CapEx just across the board to increase capacity for noncore products although that demand is still high because we plan on exiting. We're focusing our CapEx investments on EFK on silicon carbide on some of the mixed signal analog that all drive growth and accretive margins. But net-net we don't see us catching up.Appreciate it.And long term I'll confirm our -- what that will do for us long term are as we exit those other fabs that we've announced already and ramp East Fishkill up fixed costs will be better overall like the numbers that Thad talked about for Belgium and our North America fab. But net-net capacity will increase about to 1.3x when we have the 300-millimeter on and we exit the low-scale fabs. So net-net we see our increase from capacity reduced fixed costs which gets us the growth that we'll be looking for in a much better fab-lighter footprint.Look there is -- of course as GLOBALFOUNDRIES exits over the last three years we have a lot of headroom to go for 300-millimeter capacity within that facility. And over the next five years as we look at the outlook and where we can do then we'll address our need for additional manufacturing event.Thank you all for joining us today. I thank our worldwide teams for their hard work in accelerating our transformation and driving record results once again with leadership in intelligent power and sensing solutions and exposure to fast-growing megatrends such as vehicle electrification ADAS energy infrastructure and factory automation we are well positioned to deliver sustained and profitable long-term revenue growth and margin expansion. Thank you.,0.0029392,0.003310859,0.000274997
181,181,HSY,Buck:,Well clearly as we are executing this capacity and looking at the future automation yes is a big lever across the business. We still have opportunities in some of our manufacturing facilities for what we call single point of automation say an automated case pack or whatever the basic automation is. And then we kind of go to the connectivity of all the different parts of our system talking to each other. And across our entire business not just supply chain we continue to look at opportunities where technology can allow us to operate more efficiently give us better insights et cetera. And then certainly as we look at our Salty business now that we are gaining more scale and have many more businesses in that portfolio. As Steve mentioned earlier weâ€™re doing a lot of work on just optimizing the overall supply chain network and what that looks like. And thatâ€™s more efficient distribution. It is more efficient manufacturing really across the board and thatâ€™s somewhat of a transformation.Yes.Yes. I donâ€™t believe we are behind. This is a category where it tends to be line priced. Itâ€™s really noise related to Easter and just the mix of items that vary across different competitors during the Easter timeframe. I think as we go forward youâ€™ll see that really even out.Okay. So we are big believers in advertising. I think weâ€™ve talked a lot about our model is we are pleased to have some of the strongest gross margins in the end of street and we believe in the model and then using some of those funds to reinvest in our brands and be one of the highest investors in the industry. Itâ€™s a highly responsive category with a strong impulsive nature as well. As you look to the rest of the year we believe we will be up mid to high single digits and we will continue to invest as we expand capacity wherever we can because weâ€™re big believers. Media efficiencies have really helped us to control the dollar cost because as a result of a new partnership and also new capabilities weâ€™ve gotten more efficiencies in our media. I think from a philosophy perspective relative to your question about digital. We have not seen decline in list and return. And I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s â€“ if theyâ€™re being offset because weâ€™ve built capabilities new capabilities to better target. And so weâ€™re actually seeing a stronger targeting capability and thus better efficiency.,0.002961338,0.003531575,0.000570238
182,182,CPRT,Liaw:,Yeah. We've not deployed based support our business in markets in which we are facing the most pressure in terms of towing vehicles. So you're right that even when there are not active storms we make good use those assets. Medium long-term I think there is -- there may well be an opportunity to invest further still here. Historically we have done very well with the third-party contractor model. They tend to be very resourceful and productive. And it's a good alignment of interest as they want to grow and support their own businesses and to work productively for us. But that's all we're going to -- it's an evolving mix and one we continue to evaluate overtime. During the catastrophic event and certainly even -- and afterwards as well we are certainly happy that we have those trucks and those drivers employed in-house. They have been very productive members of our team.Morning Bret.Many of those cars are -- we have not yet sold the majority of the cars. So they're coming in -- many of them in the second quarter and some no doubt will -- there be a tail that takes longer still than that.No we don't break that out. And Bret the share commentary I think as you know is along that comment product find in literally every earnings call. It's been true for a long time the industry tends to move more slowly in terms of switching providers but over the very long haul we have generally speaking grown our share both in the insurance realm and certainly in the non-insurance as well. And that was true in this quarter as it was in the past 30 quarters as well.No I think the long-term wins of history would suggest we move the other way that we migrate eventually from principal to a consignment basis. The principal business for example in the UK when we entered in 2007 was largely principal oriented and today we shifted a strong majority over to a consignment basis instead which we think is a better long-term alignment of our incentives with those of our sellers. As opposed to being principals to trade against them we are on the same side rooting for the highest possible sale price for those cars. Now the realms in which we do have more principal activity tend to be places where we are less established as a known brand and a known quantity. So today we are not yet a prominent consumer brand. So it's tough to ask Bret Jordan to consign his car through us and assume that we'll get a good return for you. Instead we can offer you a compelling price. You sell the car to us and we sell it in turn as a principal. And ditto in the UK in the early days. Today that's no longer necessary because we certainly are a well-established brand among the insurance industry and otherwise in the UK. The point being all long term as liquidity grows as our recognition grows in those subsections of the marketplace so to speak will migrate to a consignment model.Of the cars that are exported I don't know off-head Bret so I don't want to speculate. But it's high. That number doesn't sound unreasonable to me in part because there is a natural filter as you might imagine for the kinds of cars that's even worth putting on a boat to get to Eastern Europe period. You will filter out the cars that are pure metal content or a couple of recycled parts and then otherwise dispose them. They tend to by their nature be the more drivable repairable cars that would ever leave the country in the first place.Thanks Bret.Sure. Nothing radical in terms of our approach. We have a very capable sales team who approaches those dealers and communicates our value proposition to them being our global auction liquidity. Subjecting your car to a global buyer base and finding the best home for that car whether it's in Ohio Florida Poland or Honduras I think there is a compelling value proposition there. But there's nothing radical that we had changed in the last quarter or 2 or 3. This is the byproduct of the auction liquidity we've talked about a moment ago as well as our own proactive sales efforts.The answer to your latter question is yes those are also relevant and addressable for us. And all cars as you all know are on a spectrum. So even what you define as a salvage versus whole car is a more nuanced matter and simply than a binary distinction between the two. But we have grown our business very naturally of course the rental car Company with a car that's slightly damaged or meaningfully damaged we are absolute obvious home for it. Older car we're a good and obvious home for it as well. The newer rental cars those of course are very meaningfully compressed in terms of industry -- available industry volume because of the shortage of new cars the fleets are hanging onto cars they've got. But yes long-term those are addressable for us as well addressable targets for us as well.I would say that I think of vehicles with some notable exceptions. The automotive industry is being a reasonably liquid global market so I don't think you could see 50% inflation for two-year-old Toyota Corollas in one market and 8% inflation in other currency adjusted. I do think we have observed increases in used car values around the world and most countries in which we do business. There are sources of friction and distortion of course when comparing those trends whether it's tariffs or shipping or otherwise. They can introduce discontinuities in that comparison. But by and large I think of the vehicle business as being a global one in nature. In terms of the long-term trends -- short-term trends I think we certainly can be affected by currency in any given auction in any given week in any given quarter maybe in any given year. But I think the long-term trends of our cars being in higher demand in other countries still than they are in the U.S. that's not going away. That's over a multiple year horizon will dwarf any currency effects.We sold a bunch but the majority have not yet been sold.Yeah. As you know we don't provide any forward guidance. Those cars will sell they will generate revenue. They do have costs associated with them. They'll have some implications. We'll talk about it next quarter.Good. Thanks everyone for joining us. We'll talk to you next quarter.,0.004072905,0.004436493,0.000479389
183,183,DG,Vasos:,Sure.Thank you.Yes Matt thanks for the question. I would tell you that our initiatives continue to push forward and also drive that topline. So if you think of DG Fresh that continues to be our top driver. But one area that we have started to talk about recently and we'll continue to hear more and more about is our digital initiative. And I would tell you that that digital initiative will continue to help propel that topline as well. It's driving not only our current customer but a different cohort of customer into Dollar General. And that is that cohort that is a little bit more digitally savvy. We have spent some nice capital over the many years building the platform for this. And really in earnest in the last six to eight months have really turned the dial up on moving that digital piece. So while others are worried about fixing fundamentals we're really moving the needle forward on a lot of those big initiatives. So you think of DG Fresh self-distribution of produce coming up in our supply chain as well you think about digital. And then of course we're so excited still about NCI and pOpshelf. pOpshelf is performing very well even in a climate that one would consider the non-consumable discretionary side of the business may be challenged. But pOpshelf continues to do well. That's what gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward into the upcoming months and years ahead. So we've got a tremendous amount of drivers a lot more than value and convenience. But when they come into the store through all these other means that we're driving traffic into the store they are definitely gravitating to value and convenience because everybody loves a deal.Yes. I would tell you that some of it was built in. We knew that the consumer was going to get tighter in 2022 just because of the lack of stimulus compared to last year. But I would tell you that because of other pressures more inflation coming through on her everyday needs as well as that fuel that I talked about has quickened the pace a little bit. So we believe that she'll flee even further to value as she moves into the back half of the year especially as she gets to that holiday time frame I believe that you'll see that. So we're very prepared for that. The last thing I'll also mention that shows us that she is starting to move that way a little quicker is one is she's coming more often in those basket unit sizes are a little bit smaller. That's the true sign and also the $1 price point that we are really pushing and getting behind has really accelerated as well and we're seeing that. So that would tell you that she's trying to make ends meet and we'll be there for her because that's what we do best.Yes. John it's a good question and thanks for that. I would tell you that we're in a much different spot not only economically meaning the consumer is in a little different spot here. And I think the biggest piece is that employment is still very healthy across all cohorts of customers that we serve. So I think that's one of the big differences here than 2008 2009. Now could that roll over? We're watching that very well could which would then just quicken the pace that flight to value. But we havenâ€™t that yet. But because of the other inflationary pieces we have seen. So there really isn't a lean-in in the playbook as much as it is knowing what that customer is going to do from historical times and then servicing I mentioned. And the reason we're leaning into that $1 price point is because we know how important that is during those times. Private brand we've seen an acceleration in our private brand business as well in recent weeks. That's a true sign that she's starting to feel that pressure. So how do we respond? Well you'll see more end caps more off-shelf displays of both $1 and private brand as we move through Q2 and then to the back half of the year. So we're really good and nimble as you know and to be able to move very quickly so you'll see more and more of that. I think the important thing here is we're so different as a company than we were in 2008 2009. I would hate to be fixing fundamentals right now because the opportunity to gain share is going to be tremendous as we I believe move through this year. And we're so far beyond that with all of the initiatives that we've put in place over the last six seven years. It's nice to see that we're going to be in a position to take an oversized amount of share we believe as we move through the back half of the year.Hi Rupesh this is Todd. Real quickly obviously we've seen what others have seen on that. We're a little different spot though and our product mix is much different than the broader retail spectrum. So I would tell you that we're seeing on average a lot less cost pressure than what you would find in retail in general. That's number one. The second piece is we have the ability here to trade off items and to trade down sizes which we've been very active over the last six eight months on when we saw inflation starting to move in a little different direction. So we've got the ability to do that. That's what we do best on our merch side. And so we've done a lot of that to also push off some of those costs to the consumer. But as it relates to when we do have to put costs out there I'm sorry additional retail to cover some of that CPG cost we've been able to do that because we do it the Dollar General way right? And we make sure that we can layer it in where the consumer still knows and sees the value of what we offer. And again as I mentioned in my earlier comment we haven't felt better about where we are. We're right in historical levels of our pricing indexes compared to all classes of trade. So I believe we've got the ability to pass on where we need to. But more importantly to help defray some of that pass on to the consumer through our category management efforts which again we're probably one of the best in the industry on.Yes. As I mentioned also a little earlier the consumer is becoming more and more intentional in our purchases. We've seen that. And what that means is taking care of our family a little bit more on the consumable side of the business where she needs to make sure she buys. And then on that discretionary side obviously tightening the belt a little bit. So yes we saw that. We knew that was going to occur just because of the stimulus lap. But as I also mentioned we saw it probably accelerated a little faster than where we thought it would as well. But the great thing is the buying team has been all over this. So what we're already doing is as we see the -- with the third and fourth quarter and be able to yet adjust we're able to go in and adjust the products that we're selling on that discretionary side as well as making sure that the prices are right on the discretionary side especially as we get to the important fourth quarter selling season. So we feel like we've seen where that consumer is probably going to land on a mix basis discretionary versus non but we also believe we've made the right trade-offs and as John indicated feel real good about our inventory levels there and not concerned at all at this point on any markdown risk that may be there.Sure.Yes. I would tell you that we actually closed out Q1 with a positive traffic number which was really good to see. And as I indicated in my opening comments like what we see on our start to Q2 and I think you can you can actually take from that that our traffic number is looking much better than it was. So we feel as we get further and further away from that stimulus lap that John referred to we believe we've got the right products initiatives price points especially in this environment to drive that traffic long term.Absolutely.Well thank you for all the questions and thanks for your interest in Dollar General. I'm proud of our team which continues to execute at a high level for our customers every day. I'm sure you can tell I'm more excited about this business than ever before. We are a mature retailer in growth mode and our strategic focus has differentiated us in a discount retail landscape particularly as we have transformed this company in the last few years. As a result I believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on the enormous growth opportunities we see in front of us. Thank you for listening and I hope you have a great day. Thank you.,0.008704796,0.02568531,0.009805028
184,184,WMB,Armstrong:,Yes thanks for your question. I don't think we've released that sensitivity on price. We have said the contracts that we have there are around our Laurel Mountain midstream business with EQT in the Marcellus has that feature as well as the Barnett gathering contracts in total and with total in the Barnett Shale so those are kind of the two primary areas of exposure to those. There's a lot of areas of smaller ones but in terms of any significance those are bigger ones. But we have not provided that. In terms of the pricing that's in there I would just tell you it's we're not counting on the kind of current pricing that we have obviously for the balance of the year. And so we're being I would say a bit conservative about what we expect for the balance of the year because we do think given the kind of growth that we're seeing in both the Haynesville and it's gearing up in the Marcellus and Utica that the workflows do we can't very well on one hand see the kind of prices to remain at these levels. And so I would say that those two things have to be considered jointly.Yes I would just say we're as usual we're going to be patient and picky and we've done that and that served us well. In the case of Trace we kind of caught that at from a timing standpoint. I think we caught that at a great timing and we had unique considerations that we had to offer Quantum and Rockcliff they're both in terms of access to LNG markets via our LEG and Transco systems as well as an interest in LEG with Quantum which was valuable to them so we will continue to look for those kind of unique opportunities as they pop up where we've got significant value that we can add between us and environs so I wouldn't say we're not going to look at everything because probably will but I think we'll remain fairly patient and picky about how we choose our points of growth.Yes great question Jeremy. And I will tell you I've been really impressed with the way our commercial teams have been working together on Sequent so I'm going to go into the back -- to the end of your question for really if you think about Sequent and the way that they run the business of optimization being in a basin that is starting to get crowded from the transport standpoint and start to have volatility in the bases and allows to capture an aggregate supplies into then turning that into an infrastructure solution is exactly what we bought Sequent for. And that's turning in to be a pretty powerful tool for us and probably while I've certainly expected over time for us to get there I've been very impressed how quickly the teams have come together to materialize some opportunities on that front. So really excited about that. And I think not just the nice performance that we got out of Sequent here in the first quarter but as well just seeing strategically what it's doing for us in terms of intelligence in the basin and dealing with volatility in basin as markets grow. And optimization of capacity becomes critical as you get up near the limits of the basins capacity to export. Again that allows us then to aggregate those supplies that need optimization and then that of course gives us a front seat as it relates to infrastructure solutions for that so really that has gone according to plan and then some I would say. On the question of monetization of the EMP business remember that first on the long starter our primary goal and the real value there is for us to build getting those volumes built up and so the structure that we have today there with Crowheart which incense them to in very powerful incentive to dramatically grow volumes. And then that cash margin of that kind of regardless of pricing environment that cash margin that flows back to us through the midstream asset is exactly what we're looking for which is obviously a much more durable solution than depending on high prices here in the current environment. So that strategy remains intact. And we remain very focused on getting the volumes built up in that basin before we would think about the next step of monetization which may very welcome there. On the angel side somewhat similar except that in that structure the undeveloped not existing producing reserves but the undeveloped acreage does transfer over as that -- as the development is done by GeoSouthern and they are just doing an incredible job I want to give them a lot of credit here on the way they've been managing as an operator out there on the drilling operations. And we're really excited to see what that's going to mean for us both in terms of responding to this very strong pricing environment we have on gas and here in the near term but as well the volumes and the cash margin that we'll get from the downstream assets in the longer term. So both of those are going extremely well. But the Haynesville obviously is going to be a much more near term catalyst for growth just given the ability to very quickly attack and drill out the acreage there in the Haynesville but some of that value will be transferred in the undeveloped acreage not in the producing acreage but in the undeveloped acreage will transfer over to GeoSouthern over time. Isn't that Chad?Yes Michael great question that model that we study a lot. And I would just say first of all that is not a well-oiled machine we're talking about there and I'm not sure if sometimes the right hand knows what left hand doing in that regard and certainly the FERC got some very clear instruction from the Energy and Natural Resource Committee. So I think that was very helpful in terms of getting the FERC lined out. The CEQ activity that you spoke about was certainly a step backwards but frankly really the previous path that the Trump administration set on CEQ was helpful but it really hadn't -- had that much impact yet on but it definitely was a step backwards. I wonder if that was a little better communication within the administration I kind of wonder if that would have come out given the need for that and the desire for natural gas infrastructure to get permitted but it certainly was a step in the wrong direction. I don't really have a comment yet on that EIS and re-licensing issue that you mentioned I am not familiar enough with that I'd like comment on that. So we have to just say yes we think there's a desire from the administration and certainly from some of the key Senate committees to streamline permitting. But I'm not sure that everybody's moving in lockstep with that amongst the various agencies just yet but I'm very hopeful given the direction that FERC responded to. I'm very hopeful that we'll see that -- to see some work.Well I would say a couple of things there. I mean yes certainly that's positive. But as well we saw a lot of certificates get issued that have been pending for some time there pretty quickly as well post the hearing that the Senate Committee held. And so we thought that was very constructive. And frankly our discussion with various commissioners indicate that they really are serious about trying to get good projects that have the ability to reduce emissions that are being done within permitted responsibly including very intense stakeholder engagement. They're serious about getting those permit and we think thatâ€™s very thoughtful --.Sure yes I would just say we're being pretty modest in those investments we have a pretty tight screening process in that regard. And we're not putting large amounts of capital to work right now on that but it is important capital because we do think it has a long term be a differentiator and we've been very clear with ourselves that we want to think about where the buck is going in that regard. And we do think that reducing methane emissions and overall greenhouse gas emissions from our natural gas value chain is absolutely essential for natural gas to be the powerful tool and be considered the most powerful tool at reducing an impact and positively climate change. So we are dead serious about making sure that on QMRV front and our ability to in an unassailable way certify responsibly sourced gas we think that's going to be very important in the long run. And so that's not super expensive because it's not big capital. But we are certainly engaging our organization and making sure that we don't sit around and wait for really good solutions to be developed we think there's a lot of efforts going on that front. But we think at the end of the day those are going to have to be really strong unassailable solutions that people can trust. And whether they're an NGO or they're a gas producer that it can be trusted. And so we're very focused on that. And we want to be there on the front lines of that but it is not big capital that we're investing in that space right now. In terms of the return component the areas that we're we are investing more sizable amounts of capital like in our solar business we are targeting mid-teens returns on those projects. Obviously that's not available in the merchant space around renewables today and we're well aware of that but given the fact that we've got our own load to serve there and we've got a lot of the essential facilities already in place. That reduced the capital load on that that's what drives the higher returns here. So Chad again if you anything to add?Yes I'll take the first part of that and I'll hand the solar question off to Chad. First of all I would just say on the policy question normally my immediate response to that would be void to a crowded field of issues and would be hard to get any movement on energy policy. But Senator Manchin has been very well seated and very well positioned to drive to the solutions and he has been putting forth some thoughts on energy policy and I'm very very thankful for that. Because I think the timing is right to get some attention to that and to actually come up with an energy policy. People would I think all of us would question whether we've actually had an energy policy or not. And so I think the timing is right for that. And I think getting some clarification on that would really benefit our country and hopefully set legislation in place that puts aside some of the ways that we continue to stand in our own way as a country and using our natural gas resource as both a powerful economic driver for us which I think in the next year or so we're going to wish we had as well as a powerful geopolitical tool obviously. And so I think the timing is right. And I think we've got a really good advocate for that in Senator Manchin. So I would just say we're very hopeful on that front. I'll turn the solar question over to Chad.Thank you very much and appreciate everybody tuning in today and appreciate great questions. I just want to reiterate here on the backhand that the drivers for the growth for the balance of the year are really powerful and really across our base business the Marcellus and Utica as we discussed obviously the Haynesville growth is powerful. And I think people are starting to see strong evidence of that. Deepwater business we've got a couple of really nice tie in projects this year that will add to value towards the end of this year. And one set or later this year as our drilling operations pick up out there towards the very end of this year we'll see volumes in the long side or that of course will be driving the base business as well out there. And then finally as I mentioned earlier the Haynesville we really haven't even seen the power of that yet on the E&P side. So first quarter was definitely not driven by that because that's really a balance of the year and into â€˜23. And really attractive earnings coming out of that area as well. So a lot of great quarter but a whole lot of firepower left here to drive growth for balance of the year and into â€˜23. And with that I thank you for your attention today and look forward to talking to you soon.,0.002775083,0.003017604,0.000181673
185,185,O,Roy:,Hi Ron. Yes. So the biggest element to closing this transaction is the licensing process and we are well in the midst of going through that process. We have submitted our application. It is being reviewed by the Massachusetts Gaming Group. And we are very hopeful that by fourth quarter we will be in a position to close this transaction. But that really is the one outstanding element to be able to close this transaction but so far so good. Everything that we are hearing everything that we have received in terms of MGCâ€™s response to our initial application has been quite positive. So we feel pretty good about that. In terms of the industry itself no surprise we are getting a lot of inbounds from potential sale-leaseback opportunities. And the team is reviewing them one at a time. But our thesis around this particular space remains the same. We want to partner with the best-in-class operators and find assets that are truly one-of-a-kind just like we did with the Boston asset. And if at a very high level those criterias are met we will absolutely continue to increase our exposure to this particular sector.Sure. So Ron I mean you have seen us grow our existing relationships to areas where they start to dominate our shareholder registry. So for instance I will give you a perfect example. We did the first sale-leaseback with Dollar General. This was I believe in 2015- 2016 timeframe and it was maybe $130 million $140 million sale-leaseback. We subsequently continued to grow our opportunity with Dollar General through multiple sale-leasebacks. Itâ€™s a similar story with 7-Eleven. A lot of these clients that you see in our top 20 have grown over multiple years and they continue to have ambitious growth profile. So that channel of growth remains for us. Then we also have the ability to do first-time sale-leasebacks in a large way with clients like Wynn. These are asset classes that tend to be very large. But again given that we are about a $57 billion $58 billion company today it is going to register as a 3.5% client. And clearly we have said this very openly that in the event Wynn decides to continue to execute and grow their footprint beyond the two locations that they currently have we would love to continue to partner with them. And so this is a function of being able to do first time sale-leasebacks in a big way. And now that we are of the size that we are our ability to absorb those â€“ and when I say big I mean $1 billion sale-leaseback even multiple billion dollar sale-leasebacks that has grown over the last few years and especially post the VEREIT merger.Sure.Yes. Hi Josh. I wish our business was a spigot where you could switch it off and turn it back on at a momentâ€™s notice. Unfortunately our business doesnâ€™t work quite like that. When you think about how we source opportunities and how we create a pipeline of opportunities and what is the timing that it takes from making a decision to pursuing a particular transaction and then closing it it could take anywhere between four months to six months from start to finish. So unless you have a crystal ball it is very very difficult to be able to sort of do exactly what you suggested which would have been perfect if we could. The other thing I would tell you is there is a lag even in our cost of capital. When you have volatile situations like this but you are seeing opportunities that seem very well priced on a pure real estate underwriting in terms of replacement costs in terms of price per pound and you think about the leases that we are able to capture with the clients that are engaging in these types of transactions you obviously build into your underwriting a particular buffer. And hopefully we have been conservative enough where we are still being able to capture positive healthy spreads to our cost of capital while continuing to enhance the â€“ our basic AFFO per share growth as well as our client registry with new relationships. So itâ€™s very difficult. We had a different mindset over the next six months to nine months which said hey the world is going to fall apart. We absolutely will pull in our horns just like we did in that very first quarter right after the â€“ it was actually the second quarter of 2020 when the pandemic hit where we slowed down our ability to sort of continue looking at transactions and truth be told even the market there the transaction market sort of went silent for a bit just because people are very unsure of how things are going to play out. But that I have already shared with you is not the case. Sourcing remains very healthy. And we feel like even with the appropriate flexing of our own cost of capital we are able to grow our business in a manner that is very much aligned with our acquisition strategy. But Josh I will be very honest if our views change we will stop continuing to build the pipeline. But that is not the case right now.The right opportunities. There are already a set of countries that we have preapproved so to speak internally and have shared with our Board that there are countries that we would like to be able to grow in the event the right opportunities come along. We have identified the businesses that we would like to do business with. We have identified the clients. We have identified the fact that these are businesses that will continue to thrive even in cycles like the one that we are experiencing. And if those boxes are checked and we are able to sort of strike the right balance in terms of spreads etcetera thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going to allow us to continue to expand our geographic footprint in Western Europe.Thank you Josh.Well John thatâ€™s what makes us different right. I mean if you look at our world vis-Ã -vis our peers we are at right around 8 years 8.5 years. And if you look at our lease maturity schedule and I think I said this during my prepared remarks that 12% of our leases are going to renew over the next 2.5 years. And so it does â€“ if we can keep this momentum I donâ€™t know if it will be 106% but the other thing I would say about that 106% is itâ€™s effectively net increases. And so if we can keep it in that ZIP code that will become a major growth driver for our business and it will become an internal growth driver of our business especially if we continue down this highly inflationary environment. The other good news is if you think about our international expansion a lot of those leases tend to be CPI-adjusted leases. And they donâ€™t tend to have this collar â€“ a ceiling and a floor that we experience here but itâ€™s a relative comment. I would say the vast majority of CPI leases that we have here in the U.S. tend to have a collar. And I would say maybe one-third to even 40% of the leases in the international markets tend to be â€“ basically do not have a collar around it and they are very much tied to CPI growth. And so I think all of that will start to percolate through our portfolio and will help us drive more internal growth than what we have historically experienced in our business. And we think of this as an opportunity and we have been talking about asset management now for about 5 years 6 years in anticipation of what we are now starting to experience as a company. And so look we think we are very positively set up to take advantage of this situation. And it then helps us alleviate some of the pressure of just growing through external measures which of course is also something that the team is doing very well.Yes. Itâ€™s by design John. We want development to continue to tick up because we do get more spread doing development. And this allows us to continue to be the one-stop solution that our clients are looking for. And just to be super clear we are talking about build-to-suit on 99% of our development. So I meanâ€¦John they are build-to-suit. So by definition they are being driven by our clients coming to us or coming to a developer and saying we would like to have you develop here in this particular location because we would like to enter into a long-term lease. And we have either relationships directly with our clients who then ask us to work with the developer or with some developers who have asked us to become their capital source as a permanent takeout. And that is whatâ€™s allowing us to continue to enhance our development pipeline. So this is absolutely being driven by the clients not by us. This was just a hole in our overall strategy that we are now addressing in a meaningful way.Thanks John.10%. Linda I am not trying to be flippant but look our intention is to try to drive that up. Some of it will naturally come with the expansion in asset types. There are certain asset types that lend themselves to higher organic growth. That was part of the attraction that we had with investing in industrial assets and we saw that. And some of these other asset types just like I said do have a higher profile than the 1% that we have traditionally been able to get in the space that we had targeted historically. So could I see that tick up thatâ€™s the hope with more international acquisition with more industrial with more development where we can create more bespoke leases. If we can get that 1% to 1.5% to 2% that would be a major uplift and a source of internal growth. But thatâ€™s not going to happen overnight. Itâ€™s going to take us time and itâ€™s going to take intentionality which we certainly have.We are not quite there where we would want to sell our theater portfolio Linda. In fact all indications have been all trend lines have indicated that the theater business is getting back to a strong footing despite all of the noise that we hear about the theater business and PBOD [ph] and all of that. In fact I was looking at some numbers in the first quarter of 2022. We are back to about 75% of 2019 levels. And so clearly this is a business that is largely driven by content. We are also very encouraged by the pipeline of big-tent movies that are going to be released over the next two months to three months. We are very hopeful that that will translate to more attendance. And the good news is a couple of these large operators like Regal and AMC are cash flowing positive on the assets that we own. So I think all of that leads us to believe that this industry as we had hoped and our hypothesis was is sort of on demand. Having said all of that we also did a fair amount of downside scenario analysis where we looked at some of these locations and we feel like we have the ability the capital the relationships to reposition these assets in the event that the business doesnâ€™t play out. I think the wrong economic decision today would be to sell some of these assets at what I would consider to be fire sale prices. And again just to remind everyone 82% of our portfolio is in the top two quartiles of performance for both these operators. So we feel very good about the theater business but more specifically about the portfolio that we own. And so the decision to sell though a theoretical one and has been considered is one that we are not in a position to execute on given some of what I just said.Thank you.Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to speaking at the upcoming NAREIT conference. Thank you all. Bye-bye.,0.101745208,0.565795422,0.207691498
186,186,HES,Rielly:,So the way I would look at it is we picked up this inflation for the second half of the year. It's really -- that's what's happening. A lot of it we did have some tubular steel kind of locked up in the first half and we're seeing some increases now going into the second half of the year. So we're picking it up for half the year. I don't necessarily think you then need to double this as you move forward. We'll see what happens with oil prices and basically industry investment too for next year. So at this point I wouldn't want to guide to that kind of level Paul. And again we do everything we can with lean and with different technology as well as again a lot of these contracts for Guyana as Greg mentioned we've kind of fixed these prices that we have so far. So at this point I think it's early for us to talk about what the inflation will be next year.Sure.Okay. So as mentioned previously from a cash tax standpoint we will not be incurring cash taxes let me just say for 5 years or anything in the near term. To your point what happens now with higher prices and more income here in the U.S. we have a full what we call sorry this is going to be accounting technical valuation allowance against that net operating loss. So there will come a point in time where we will release that valuation allowance effectively book a big gain increase equity. And then what would happen is as you use the NOL we would be recording deferred tax expense. The exact timing of that Paul I don't know at this point. But again this would all be noncash from that standpoint.Roger it was baked in there. We're not seeing as much there on the cash cost cash operating costs the capital. There's no question there is some. It was in the number. But the biggest driver on that increase in the cash cost per BOE is the production taxes which is driven by higher prices. So again that helps our margins that way. So that -- when you're seeing that real increase there it's really that increase in production taxes that's driving that higher cash cost.No. Not really Bob. Now look we did set that out in a $65 world that's for sure. That was how we set that up. All our forecasts going out is in a $65 world. So obviously there can be impact. Again like I just mentioned with production taxes being higher from that standpoint. But you are correct that really what drives that down is Guyana. And in fact if you look just at our numbers and the guide I gave and you just did the math on the second half of the year second half of the year has to average about $12.60 on that cash cost to get to those numbers basically in the midpoint. And what's going to happen is third quarter will be a little bit higher and then the fourth quarter is going to be lower than that $12.60. Why? Again because Guyana continues to build up its production. So the more and more now that Payara is moving up early and that it's -- to your point it's that mix and having Guyana just drive down our cash costs as well as Greg mentioned getting that fourth rig on we'll optimize our infrastructure and lower our unit cost in the Bakken as well.,0.003210783,0.003595233,0.00038445
187,187,DHI,Auld:,Good morning.I donâ€™t see any change in the incentives coming. Itâ€™s â€“ Iâ€™m sure at some point the inventory will catch up with demand. It is still significantly out of balance especially if youâ€™re looking at the areas where the Florida the Texas the Arizonas even across the Midwest where you have job growth and influx of people. Itâ€™s â€“ you never say never but the difficulty of getting lots on the ground and then getting houses built is â€“ itâ€™s going to be very difficult to catch up with demand anytime in the next couple of years.It goes back to market scale and even within submarkets being able to control a labor base and keeping them busy keeping them in the same location. I just canâ€™t over â€“ I canâ€™t oversell that advantage where youâ€™ve got a program where weâ€™re releasing 15 20 30 houses every month month after month after month after month. The aggregation of labor in those kinds of communities is â€“ itâ€™s very advantageous in todayâ€™s world. And it also gives you the ability to kind of direct some of that labor through the two or three or four or five a month absorption communities. So itâ€™s market scale. Itâ€™s â€“ again everything that weâ€™ve done simplifying the product trying to maintain affordability and then having well-located communities with long running times so.Thank you.Good morning.Good morning.Yes. Mike Iâ€™ve always â€“ weâ€™ve always believed that the rental platform when we get it built out will derisk our land portfolio because it does give us another lever. But from a just a philosophical standpoint we believe in the fore sale business. We believe home ownership in the country is very important. Today our goal is to deliver more homes because the demand is there and itâ€™s hard to believe five years from now homes are going to be more affordable than they are today. So every family we can get in the home we feel like we â€“ is a win for us and for that family. When we look at the risk in the rental platform the ability to scale that up the segment thatâ€™s going to create â€“ itâ€™s going to be a real business all on its own. And because of the geographic platform and the embedded divisions within that geography our ability to scale that and touch every market is â€“ we see as just great opportunity for our shareholders and for our people internally.You bet.Hey Ken.We have start targets and we talk about consistent sustainable starts driving ultimately sales and closings and itâ€™s based on the capacity within divisions to deliver those homes.Itâ€™s a great time. Housing is more affordable today than it certainly was in the 1980s. The ability to get into a house lock down your homeownership or your housing cost for the next 20 years is a significant driving force in whatâ€™s going on because as overall cost inflation interest rates as those continue to move up the people that have bought a house today even if itâ€™s at a price thatâ€™s 15% 20% higher than it was last year are â€“ I mean itâ€™s just a great thing. So the other thing Ken that we really donâ€™t talk much about but itâ€™s â€“ when I was 20 I mean that was just â€“ that was what was expected. You figured out a way to buy a house and that became less cool for use of a stupid term as the millennials came into their 20s. But what Iâ€™m seeing and what my millennial daughter is telling me is now itâ€™s â€“ thatâ€™s a big part of the narrative on social media is itâ€™s â€“ people want to own homes again. And itâ€™s just â€“ I think Iâ€™m amazed sometimes at some of the conversations around housing and I look at what it was and look at what it is. I look at the â€“ just the demographic demand thatâ€™s out there I look at the wealth effect of everything thatâ€™s happened over the last 10 years and the American public is. Theyâ€™re in a good place and from an affordability standpoint home ownership is better than it was in the 1980s. So Iâ€™m very optimistic about whatâ€™s going on. Iâ€™m very optimistic about this company and Iâ€™m just in all of our people and how â€“ what they are accomplishing out there so.I donâ€™t know if I answer your question but I thought you got it I think.We actually were talking about this and getting ready for the call. The private builders and even some of the smaller public builders are going to have very difficult time delivering houses. I mean weâ€™re having â€“ it is hard for us. I mean itâ€™s probably harder to complete and finish a house today as itâ€™s been in my career in homebuilding. And as these private guys who donâ€™t have our scale who donâ€™t have our ability to driver result their houses are setting and thatâ€™s going to cut off their access to the next house they start. Anecdotally we are talking to the builders end markets theyâ€™re just tired. They donâ€™t â€“ theyâ€™ve got six seven eight banks. Theyâ€™re sideways with two of them and theyâ€™re looking to us to take out their log supply and they maybe become a developer for us in that market. So itâ€™s â€“ if the supply chains donâ€™t loosen up I think youâ€™re going to see the consolidation accelerate in the market by the big box because what is the big constraint on the market on housing is the ability to get lots in front of you. And the private guys they donâ€™t have that ability that publics do and thatâ€™s â€“ so when you look at new home sales decline that doesnâ€™t have anything to do with demand that has to be built â€“ 60% of the homes being built out theyâ€™re being built by non-public. And I think all of this cycle youâ€™re going to see that groupâ€™s ability to start houses continue to deteriorate and that is going to get picked up by the public. Even if the overall housing market â€“ new home housing market declines I think the top 10 [indiscernible] are going to pick up market share and theyâ€™re going to continue to grow. So thatâ€™s what happening.Yes. There is a big population base there now. Youâ€™ve got some of the best universities in the country that are there. Youâ€™re seeing a migration out of what weâ€™ve historically been the tech areas and/or the think tank areas financial areas into these incubators which are these major universities. Iâ€™m just â€“ Iâ€™m a big believer that long-term the quality of life just the access to really smart people is going to drive companies and grow companies into these markets. You see it in Austin. You see it in Nashville Columbus. Itâ€™s just across Indianapolis. There are brilliant people starting what are going to be great big companies that that find that that environment just a better place to be than some of the what has historically been high tech high income markets. And the population of the U.S. it â€“ those towns those cities are great cities and they offer a lot and thatâ€™s what...Thank you.Thank you Holly. We appreciate everybodyâ€™s time on the call today and look forward to speak with you in our second quarter results in April and our the D.R. Horton family outstanding first quarter. Itâ€™s amazing whatâ€™s the â€“ our people are accomplishing it there and Don Horton and the entire executive team are humbled with the opportunity to represent you. Thank you.,0.00269942,0.003118157,0.00025147
188,188,LNG,Fusco:,Yes absolutely. I mean you should think of us as a southwest of liquefaction trains right? We have 9 trains that are the same design and there should be significant synergies now on parts and labor and operational effectiveness.Well needless to say that the EU has been very very helpful and very grateful for what weâ€™ve been able to do and the 150 cargoes that that were produced at Cheniere and sent to Europe. Our relationship with the regulators FERC FEMSA the administration has always been strong. Weâ€™ve talked about it before that the Obama administration approved our ability to export and our permits to build the facility. And we continue to work collaboratively with all of them. I was very pleased that we got tank one back in service and that weâ€™re working closely with them on tank three. Weâ€™ve got the additional capacity from FERC on our debottlenecking efforts and then we got the DOT non-FTA approval. So weâ€™re getting what we need. Theyâ€™re very busy these days. Weâ€™re having to be patient but weâ€™ll continue to work collaboratively with the bunch.Yes. So Iâ€™ll start and Iâ€™ll ask Anatol if he wants to jump in on it. Weâ€™ve got very strong relationships with our customers and we pretty much â€“ an ability for us to continue to grow this business. So I feel very comfortable that Cheniere will grow for many many years hereafter. I think the brownfield aspects canâ€™t be matched. You can see from our Stage 3 that the economics are extremely strong and I think thereâ€™s more run rate left.Thanks.Look you heard from Zach Sean that weâ€™re building Stage 3 at six times EBITDA that creates a significant amount of long-term value. So I do think â€“ thereâ€™s the build and buy situation. Iâ€™ve seen it my whole career and for the foreseeable future I just think we can build it faster better cheaper than buying it from someone else.Yes I can only speak for Cheniere but Iâ€™ll just say weâ€™re quite confident just with our bank group which is a mix of say 30 to 40 project finance and investment banks that in the next couple months weâ€™ll get binding commitment for $3.5 billion to $4 billion spread letâ€™s say 1.5% or so. And thatâ€™s not going to need any government agency funding support whatsoever or XM support. So we have a bank process thatâ€™s already kicked off and weâ€™re going to get what we need really efficiently and quite attractive as well from the regular bank market. So canâ€™t really speak to those that may need that.Thank you.No. Iâ€™d say we have two great sites and two great assets. We have additional real estate at both sites and itâ€™s not out of the question to see us pivot â€“ either do them both or pivot to back to Sabine. The third birth is coming along very well. I know there havenâ€™t been any questions on it but we would expect to receive our first shift there sometime at the end of this year. And then weâ€™ll have more infrastructure there to load additional ships. So weâ€™re very excited about our prospects. But I â€“ Ben if you can I got to keep my team focused on making sure we execute whatâ€™s in front of us. And we get Stage 3 across the finish line. Thatâ€™s first and foremost for all of us here. And then weâ€™ll look at additional growth potential.Very well Zach.No. I just wanted to thank everybody for their continued support of Cheniere. It has been an interesting time to be in the energy markets and we appreciate all of your support.,0.003564149,0.00372684,0.000162691
189,189,STZ,Newlands:,Certainly. So first -- your first part of your question regarding June and you're correct well it isn't over yet. We're very enthused by how June is setting up and is certainly consistent with our long-term algorithm assuming we finished the last couple of days strongly. So we think June is going to look pretty good. Secondly relative to households Nik we obviously are continuing to develop and broaden our reach across our core brands particularly in beer. If you think about Modelo and Garth I think said this in prior quarters we are rapidly increasing our penetration in the non-Hispanic community. It's a little difficult for us at this point to break that out of how much of that was COVID versus non-COVID because we're just seeing such an acceleration of Modelo not only in its core Hispanic market but in the broader market as well. So it's a little difficult for us to put an exact percentage on any of those things. What I would say is we are gaining consumers in our portfolio that has been obvious and we expect that trend to continue. Part of that has been driven by our innovation agenda. We are meeting more consumer needs more consumer drinking occasions than we ever have before because of our successful innovation agenda across the whole portfolio across the company. So I would expect that we're going to continue to see some acceleration of bringing new consumers in because we are opening up occasions for those people to come into our franchise.Sure. We continue to keep our algorithm about beer pricing as we have said on prior calls. We see it as a 1% to 2% growth profile over the course of the year and we're sticking with that. We think that's appropriate given all the factors that we weigh when we decide about what we're going to do with our pricing. I think it's also important to say our number one growth driver in our business continues to be Modelo which is very accretive on a mix basis. So as we continue to see all of our businesses grow when you see that kind of acceleration in Modelo it certainly is mix accretive to us as well. So I think both of those things were additive in the quarter and we would expect them to be additive over the course of the year.We'd expect that the abatement of supply issues to take care of themselves over the course of the year. Remember I think we probably made this reasonably clear. We lost several points of top-line growth because of the power outage that occurred at the end of February in Northern Mexico and in Texas. So we certainly had a muted shipping scenario. We will expect to pick that up over the course of the remainder of the year. And we're still expecting demand to be very solid. So we are fully expecting to meet the demand that we'll see in the marketplace which we continue to say will be in that 7% to 9% range over the course of the year.Yes that's the average over the course of the quarter. As Garth pointed out in his remarks that still is below what we were pre-pandemic but it's a really big increase to what it was last year. So we still think certain markets are developed more quickly than others as we've said in prior discussions as well. So we certainly expect that's going to continue to be an accelerator over the course of the summer. And let's face it I think it would be fair to say there's a lot of pent-up consumer demand to simply go out of your home that people are looking forward to the opportunity as some of the COVID restrictions come off. We would expect to see some continuing acceleration in the on-premise channel as we progress through the summer recalling that the on-premise channel was a fraction of what it was last year versus the prior year. So we think that's all are going to take good care of itself as the year goes on.So related to the Hard Seltzer capacity point we're still expecting that the Hard Seltzer category is going to grow somewhere in the 30% to 50% range somewhere in that range this year overall. And obviously we did roughly 10 million cases last year with one SKU. We've introduced our second Variety Pack. We're very excited about that process so far and Limonada is just hitting the market really as we speak. I got to remind you again what I said earlier which is despite doubling the size of our ABA and Hard Seltzer capability for this year the number one growth driver in our portfolio will remain Modelo irrespective of that significant growth. So we are very comfortable with our growth profile across the business. What I would say is this is -- we do have significant flexibility around the capacity that we put in and how that can be used within the business. And many of the things like packaging and so forth really serve as the entire business anyway. So we do have a fair amount of flexibility depending on if there's any changes in any of the particular sub-segments of the beer category at any point in time. We've worked very hard to make sure there is flexibility within our production capacity capabilities so that we can adjust to any change in consumer demand.Sure. Let me take that one Greg. The -- we have seen it accelerate tremendously. But as we've seen over the course of the last 18 months around the pandemic you often see some things where you get starts and stops and things improve in certain states and don't improve in other states and so on and so forth. I think the important thing from our perspective to look at is while we've seen 250% growth in our depletions in the quarter versus prior year the overall percentage of our business that the on-premise represents is still a bit less than it was in fiscal year wherein calendar -- excuse me calendar year '19. So we still think there's still some opportunity and acceleration to come. We also have had an exceptional -- and our distributor network does an exceptional job of winning the times that matter things like 4th of July Labor Day. We did it with Cinco de Mayo we did it with Memorial Day. So we still think there's going to be some good opportunities for acceleration. The challenge to predict how much of the channel shifting that occurred? There was a massive amount of channel shifting that occurred a year ago when you went heavily to the off-premise. You're now seeing the on-premise comes back on and the IRI and Nielsen data has been somewhat muted. So we also have seen as we noted in our scripts a significant increase in our three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer across the business. So how all those channels sort of shake out is a real question. I think the encouraging part remains. The consumer demand against our business across all channels that we can track has been extraordinarily strong and we're excited and we think that will continue irrespective of which channel the consumer chooses to engage in.Sure. So let's start with question around the on-premise. Keep in mind based on what we can see per capita consumption has remained pretty steady throughout the pandemic. It's just that where and how people consume has moved around quite a bit. So it's really difficult to precisely predict how consumers are going to operate. And I think it's going to vary as I said a moment ago quite a bit by state depending on the individual restrictions and whether or not certain states are still allowing takeaway from a restaurant environment for alcoholic beverages some are not. So until all this dynamic plays itself out I think it's going to be very difficult to predict exactly how the consumer will land. Other than I would say some of the sheer shopping behavior where you see three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer changes are going to continue. As we've said in prior calls we have made major investments to increase our capability in three-tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer and I'm very glad that we did. It's playing out well and it's showing tremendous takeaway in those sectors which have grown around the pandemic. As it relates to inventory we continue to believe we're going to have a very solid year. We're in a good position to make up the challenge that was the one-time challenge around the power outage that occurred in February and we expect to have as we've said a very strong year and that I would expect would include the second quarter which is upon us.Yes you bet. So let me start with the first half and then Garth will cover the second half. The one thing that we haven't mentioned today but it's an important one is -- but we did mention it in prior quarters. Our Obregon opening of the extension of Obregon was delayed roughly a quarter last year -- at the end of last year because we weren't able to construct during COVID. So that is certainly going to help our inventory position as we move forward as that's now up and running. It's not running as efficiently as it will once we get everything locked and loaded because it's just a normal startup. But it's certainly helping the situation and we certainly expect to be able to meet consumer demand during our key summer selling season as I said earlier. We're being -- we're working very carefully with our distributor network and our retail partners to make sure that we are able to meet the demand. Admittedly the demand has been robust and continues to be very strong but we are expecting to be able to meet that demand and certainly Obregon is a big helper in that area. Garth you want to take that out?Certainly. Well as you know we are very fortunate with our Mexican beer portfolio to have the strength of brands that we do. These are iconic authentic brands from Mexico that our Hispanic community is very much behind. And we continue to see strength and growth. As I've said you I think -- not to you but I've said in prior calls we continue to see opportunities with Modelo/ The household penetration with Modelo despite the rapid growth of Modelo is still not at the level of Corona as an example. We're also seeing over-development in the Hispanic community with our Corona Hard Seltzer. So we are reaching into that community by again meeting new occasions and meeting new consumer needs with those particular products. So we are very comfortable with the growth profile that we see in the Hispanic community with our iconic portfolio from Mexico and we think the Seltzer element is going to be an important and hopeful part of continuing the relationship with the Hispanic community recognizing that we're also doing a great job of expanding those brands into the non-Hispanic community as well.I'll take the price part Garth. Maybe you take the first part. Relative to the price we continue to believe 1% to 2% is going to be our long-term expectation. We think that balances appropriately the dynamics that occur with price sensitivity when you raise your price and recognizing it does obviously help you cover any inflationary effects during the course of the year. So we're pretty comfortable that algorithm of 1% to 2% is the right answer that balances all of those factors and we would see that continuing well into the future.Thank you everyone for joining our call today. I think it should be clear the fiscal '22 is off to a strong start providing us with continued momentum as we head into our key summer selling season. Our powerful collection of consumer connected brands across beer wine and spirits continues to gain traction and we are well-positioned to deliver another strong year of performance consistent with our long-term goals. Our robust cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in line with our commitment to return $5 billion to shareholders by fiscal '23 and we look forward to updating everyone throughout the fiscal year as we expect to make continued progress during fiscal '22. In closing I'd like to wish all of you a happy 4th of July and hope that your celebrations with family and friends include our fantastic beer wine and spirit products. Thank you again everyone and have a good summer.,0.003679901,0.006082594,0.001155941
190,190,WELL,Mitra:,Yes. So Steve if you recall the initial phases of this pandemic we have done many transactions in call it low single -- low double-digit unlevered IRR which said as the market started to come back as sort of translated into a high single-digit unlevered IRR right? And given what happened in the marketplace in the last 30 days with financing market totally blew up. As I said leverage is down cost of leverage is significantly up and IO completely vanished. If you think through that that's really put a levered IRR model upside down right? So we are now starting to see -- I've seen more deals dropping from contracts in the last 30 days than I've ever seen in my career. So we are starting to see that all the deals are bouncing back. We always have said that price is a price we give people a price underwrite a deal on an unlevered basis. So for us it doesn't really change anything and we'll t he price. And we're seeing all those things that are coming back. So it is that I don't want to get too excited but I'm starting to see the emergence of sort of those low double-digit unlevered deals starting to pop up again.Derek we don't want to get into month by month but you're -- obviously the way you were thinking about this question is the correct one. We have seen steady improvement through the quarter and we have seen significant improvement post the quarter right? So if in or coming in we have seen that which is frankly -- so what sort of gives us confidence that we think where things are continuing in the second quarter as well as in the back half of the year. This is obviously I want to -- I said this -- and I'm going to say this again we're not in the business of predicting COVID. All bets are off if you have a massive COVID spike again. But that's what we're seeing in normalized market conditions things are improving rapidly. I don't know Tim do you want to add anything to that?Yes. So what's most attractive about Oakmont is Oakmont is one of the best operators in the business. I mean -- so we -- I mean look at -- we have mentioned this before -- they're one of the first ones to come back to sort of 90-plus percent occupancy range. If you look at Oakmont's portfolio performance it'll be hard for us to believe for kind performance that there was a pandemic that good in operation. Now going back to the point what else is very attractive. We disclosed obviously I think a couple of quarters ago that we signed a long-term partnership development partnership with them. So we're very excited about that. We think we're going to create significant value for Oakmont principles as well as well as Welltower shareholders for us to come. And CCRC so we did not bring Oakmont to the CCRC it's a CCRC that Oakmont developed in currently with a lot of -- obviously this is not just entry-level CCIC. There's also a lot of rental units in there. So we thought they do an extraordinary job of that. And as we always said just don't think about these things as this moniker CCRC this that the RIDEA triple doesn't change what fundamentally the business is. These are large campuses. New things that we got at a basis and at a cash flow and see a potential growth of cash flow that we think we can make a lot of money. So that's what we see about the partnership. We also bought four traditional rental model together that we think obviously is going to create meaningful growth as well. A lot of these assets open to 2021. So you are not going to see probably a very significant amount of earnings contribution in 2022 but you will see potentially significant amount in 2023 and beyond.I'm not going to comment philosophically what I think on hostile and not frankly speaking it's an inappropriate for us to do that. I will guarantee you that we will not go hostile. That's not how we do business. We believe that were win-win people and we like to deal with people who actually -- it just think about it just very simply reciprocation is how the world works. You walk into an elevator you smile at a person 95% of the time that person smiles back at you that's called mirrored reciprocation. We like to deal with people who believe in mirror reciprocation or we can do win-win transactions with people. We have zero desire to go hostile on HR or anybody.Okay. You asked three questions. I'll see if I remember all of these. So first is I will say that we invest and I think I said this before and I'm going to say this again we invest -- and if there are two conditions that get satisfied. One we think it's at a reasonable basis relative to replacement cost; b we think we can add significant value on the operational side. These are the two things that needs to come together for us to invest capital in no matter what the specific one is. My view of this hasn't changed. I'm not going to get into buy this sell that that do this. It just not -- that's not just -- that's not appropriate for a conversation. It just depends on what asset you're talking about right? So we're not going to obviously get into that. But I will tell you what I have mentioned in my prepared remarks. At the price you know for us we do everything at a price. At the price that we offered we thought HR shareholders will be much better off than going with the HTA merger. That was our opinion right? And that the price was for the assets as well as releasing them from a potential transaction which all of you have described as a significantly dilutive deal and market voted as such right? So you got to think about asset plus liability not just assets. That is a fundamental mistake of characterization of what's happening here. Regardless that's not as I said that each of our shareholders and their Board which is representative of the shareholders progress not ours. So it is very inappropriate for us to keep talking about something but there's nothing to talk about right? We're much more focused as I said about 30 40 other owners who are very happily engaging with us to see how we can transact how can we have a win-win transaction. And I don't have anything more to add to that.We are encouraged by the April as well as early May trends. And we're also encouraged very much where the pricing is going. Remember John's focus is on revenue maximization and frankly NOI maximization. But we're very encouraged by both occupancy and rate trends and I'm assuming you're asking a senior housing so in the senior housing portfolio.We need to be comfortable to see that COVID is not around us.Yes. So Mike you were asking about my favorite topic and you are asking me to venture a guess right? So this is a pure guess and I understand you asked about it. But just start from the position of -- I don't know of any other sector where you can have pricing power in the high 70% kind of occupancy or mid- to high 70% occupancy range right? So we're very encouraged what's happening. But today the pricing is driven by the necessity as I described a couple of calls ago or maybe last call on the necessity of keeping up with the quality of service cost of everything is going up including labor and we do not believe cutting on services. So that's just sort of the -- what's happening right now; however there is going to be at a point not so distant future and probably in the high 80% occupancy rate where you will be -- you don't -- you wouldn't have rooms to sell. And then you're going to have a different type of pricing increase right? So that -- these two obviously provide a very very good backdrop and if you think through what are the development deliveries right that in the next few years are -- a couple of years are. And obviously it takes a lot of time to bring supply back particularly as you think through what happened right? The last sort of nail on the coffin for a development project was the financing cost and that's also now gone completely crazy. So you have costs going up every month for 1.5% to 2% no one is going to give you a GMP for beyond these days before you lock something in for more than a week. That's kind of a crazy cost environment we are. So in putting it all together pricing car can sustain for a very long period of time in this kind of demand supply scenario. Now going back to your street rate conversation I'll just give one example and one example doesn't obviously is not represented on the whole portfolio. We have seen in April some of our operators have raised street rates by 15% while that in-house rate increases 8% 9% 10% right? So we're starting to see for at least for a handful of operators street rates has already -- increases are going above in-house rate increases. A phenomena we haven't seen I don't know don't hold me to it. Probably I don't know probably 2013 '14 time frame. But so we're pretty excited about it. We think that we have a long runway of pricing increase here. And frankly as we fundamentally believe that our residents expect a lot from us they're paying a lot and they expect a lot to reserve a lot and for that it just costs more today.Yes. So Nick if you look at Page 12 of our business update you will see some sense of how seasonally plays out right? We have laid that out. Obviously we expect better than seasonal trends significantly better than seasonal trends. In the second quarter but where you see the ship really takes off within the third quarter. So thinking about it without getting into month-to-month as I have already indicated the selling season the summer selling season just started right? We see very encouraging signs already and we think it will continue to improve as we go forward. Also remember usually every year in the Q1 is sort of when you go into -- from Q1 to Q2 going to start at a hole right because you lose occupancy. This year we did not start at a hole right? We built occupancy where you see occupancy decline. That will have a tremendous impact as you build the revenue line through the rest of the year. Tim do you want to provide anything else?Three questions there but we will welcome to our call. I will try to remember everything you want. First is no it doesn't excite us more or less investing is about price. It's not about exposure. I cannot say this million times enough and if we call for you guys to understand how we allocate capital. It is all about price. We own more senior housing than anyone. We bought more senior housing than anyone even the last 18 months. So senior housing is going to do significantly better. There has been no other beneficiary more beneficiary than us right? So having said that you think about the point I also want to make sure you hear me. I said for a specific operator I don't want you to think street rates are going up 15% right? So everywhere that's not what's happening. But we see broad momentum of increasing street rate pretty much everywhere with every operator okay? So let's just put that in the context of understanding how senior housing works. Remember you have an acuity creep as people age in place or age in a community okay? So you will always have the portion who is living versus the person who is coming in there's a gap right? There's a gap because of that to decrease the frailty and the acuity creep. What we are seeing this rapidly rising street rate is closing that gap pretty meaningfully. And we hope that we'll see at some point that gap is going to come together. But at the same point I understand as we sort of get to the next year right there's going to be significant in-house rate increases again. So you create another gap and you chase that gap again right? That's how you build revenue. So we're pretty optimistic. Generally speaking the tone of your question is the right one which excites us very much this moving obviously rates that we are starting to see we'll see that will be sustained all things being equal through the year and will show up in our top line growth as well as the NOI growth that Tim and John talked about.In fact April probably was the best month we have seen from a net hiring perspective since we've started tracking this from the beginning of COVID. So you haven't seen the impact that we're talking about you'll see that obviously in Q2 on a sequential basis but again I'm not going to comment on COVID. I have no way to predict what COVID is happening not happening going. But in a normalized market conditions you will see that will improvement and will significantly expect the second half of the year.One thing about me that you probably have noticed over the years we know each other that I'm extremely consistent. In 2018 I said there are two portfolios that I hope that we had in the RIDEA portfolio. In 2022 I'll tell you the same thing. And maybe if I couldn't convince the last one I'll keep saying the same thing for years to come. So you should not expect a lot to change unless we believe there is fundamentally economic reasons to change from RIDEA to triple net. Fundamentally we believe it's the same business different structures for different reasons different growth profile. So I've gone through this in the call before so I don't want to waste your time. But that just -- you should not expect a lot more except that one that I have hoped for for many many years. So let's just now take the second part of your question. So where you are today Tim talked about it probably three four calls in a row now that we have a significant portion of our triple and portfolio in cash collection right? And he mentioned when the growth comes back you will see the other side of it. We have taken it on our chin right by putting in cash collection. And now we're on the other side. So obviously that line item for these operators are behaving like RIDEA right because that's what they are. They are cash collection. So on top of that we have a substantial number of leases that are marked to inflation. And as inflation is going up so you have overall portfolio is going up. So that probably -- these two together probably 35% 40% of the triple-net portfolio and that's why you are seeing obviously that's why not only you are seeing we continue to see significant sort of above average growth as long as we have average inflation that sort of in the system. Tim do you want to add anything to that?Steve I have no comments on HR HTA merger. I will say that it remains a fragmented industry that one player size or lag thereof doesn't really make a difference. It's a health system driven industry and remains a very very fragmented industry. So I have no comments other than the fact we don't see anything changing. But I will offer a comment that I already have offered and bore you with details of what I've already said. At Welltower we don't have a strategic acquisition. The only strategy that we have is to make money on a per share basis for existing shareholders. That is the only strategy we follow. And anything that doesn't fit to that model we don't do it right? So please understand never count on us to do a strategic acquisition because we'll never will.Okay. I will -- I hope I remember all the questions. First we're not going to get into how many of these transactions will be in OP units or not. We might have given some indication of our previous press releases on some of the transactions. But beyond that we're not going to get into how many will be or will not be. We have a general sense but we're not going to get into that. But let's just talk about something else that you asked which is if you think about the pipeline of $1.5 billion under contract right? Think about what Tim said the $1.8 billion of capital that's raised in the ATM but not settled. We have a few hundred million dollars of disposition and that's just the equity piece right? You add X million that you think will come from the OP side and then on a 65-35 you will see our investment sort of dry power for investment is actually $3-plus billion today right? So that's sort of the question. And is there anything else I did not answer. I can't remember three questions at the same time Rich. But -- so I think I answered all your questions if not just call me on my cell and we'll just walk you through. But we have ample capacity to invest capital that in the pipeline or could be in the shadow pipeline. Pipeline costs to deals under contract. Shadow pipeline is what we are negotiating. And as I said off that $2-plus billion we might do zero because we transact at our price and the price is the price. And if we can convince someone to come to our price we will do that transaction. So very much of we have the capital raised but I cannot guarantee you that we apply to any of these transactions.,0.021584548,0.153544784,0.049876758
191,191,ANET,Ullal,": So to help you answer the Microsoft partnership you may have seen the quote in our earnings release. We consider Microsoft a very strategic and preferred partner and so do they of us. The use cases are expanding. And of course that like I've always said doesn't mean we get 100% of the use cases for the business. They've always had multi-vendor and open. And from time to time they've chosen other partners for other use cases. So it doesn't change at all our status with them but obviously means they're going to always be multi-vendor and open. Anshul you want to add to that?: Yes.: It's organic demand absolutely. We have backlog. We don't talk about that. And we have an increase in deferred all 3 or 2. We just have to ship.: Yes Samik. We are seeing no change in the enterprise momentum. It's strong. We haven't seen any slowdown maybe it will later on. You have the impact of inflation trends who knows? But at the moment things are looking very strong. Chris Smith Ashwin and the whole team are just knocking at the door always for products. They're certainly creating the demand with their customers. And as for the campus a very similar story. Our goal is to double this year and we've only had 1 quarter but 1 quarter doesn't make a trend but this 1 quarter alone is showing a trend in that direction. And as I think you asked me on Analyst Day I shared with you that we will grow at least to 750 million by 2025. I think we can achieve that perhaps if we are in a less constrained environment we could beat it too.: Well we've always viewed NVIDIA as a partner especially for the DPUs and NICs when they were Mellanox and we continue to view that. There are times when companies choose a vertical stack. And I think NVIDIA's focus on Spectrum 4 is more as a vertical stack for their captive customer opportunities. As a horizontal best-of-breed we don't see them as a competitor at all. And Arista is poised to be best of breed and continues to be the preferred choice with customers. Anshul you want to add to the 51 terabit road map?: Yes. Aaron I bring it up more because I think it's a strategic innovation much like Arista pioneered cloud networking with the leaf-spine architecture and when it came to the forefront with a front-end network that was based on that architecture. What we see here is that the back-end network is changing and that this seems to primarily be interconnect bus-based InfiniBand-based and high-performance clusters HBC as it's often called. But the new AI workloads really are data and compute-intensive and they can't be bus or IO-based alone or just focus on latency. They are pushing -- we're pushing the envelope of Ethernet to really deal with the predictable latency the ability to scale a whole network et cetera. Very much in the first innings. So you're right to say it's starting with the early deployment of cloud customers much like cloud itself started 5 years ago. But I think it's going to penetrate some of the specialty clouds and workloads and large enterprises as well. But this will emerge and take place over the next 3 to 5 years. It's not going to happen overnight.: Right. So supply chain is getting worse because of the extended lead times not just because of that because we were planning for that but because of the sudden surprising decommit. So when they're trying to build a product and ship it out and suddenly we don't have these last 2 components it just freezes the whole supply chain and our ability to commit to revenue. So as Ita said what do you do at that point? John and the team had to go scarring the face of the earth to get parts that would normally cost x that are now 100x in many cases. And that's a very stressful thing because sometimes you get them and sometimes we don't. So our ability in Q1 to shift more was very much there but a constraint in Q1 to ship more was also problematic because we couldn't get the parts. And that is the story for Q2 and perhaps will go into Q3 as well. Now how does that affect us? We may be executing better than others but it's affecting us in that because of the elevated cost of these components and expedite it's showing up as gross margin. So we have a gross margin pressure for the next couple of quarters both due to the cloud mix which was your second question and the commitments from Microsoft and Meta and other cloud titans as well as these expedites that are adding double pressure on our gross margin. So that's what we wanted to take away. We're going to execute as best as we can. Customers come first. We're going to do our best there even if it means buying these components at very very elevated costs. Do you want to answer the cloud question and especially with Microsoft and Meta Anshul?: Yes Jim thank you for the congratulations and wishes. So we made a pricing increase that we spoke to you about in November. The effectiveness of the pricing is very difficult to control right away. So first of all we give them some notice. So historically we have. And so orders in flight don't get affected by the pricing. Orders and backlog also don't get affected by the pricing. So all said and done even though we're getting new orders with the new pricing everything that's shipping in Q1 Q2 Q3 and a good chunk of Q4 will have the old pricing. That's what we're trying to say. Orders we're getting now will reflect the new pricing and that will come in late Q4 or 2023. We are contemplating a second price increase given the tremendous pressure we have on costs. And -- but again once again if we make it now its effect is not going. Does that help you answer the question?: Okay. So you're asking about durability of our orders and authenticity of our orders if I understood it correctly right?: First of all because we don't -- we fulfill through channels but so much of our orders are very intimate relationships with our customers to answer your second question first. We really believe the orders are not double booked or double ordered there may be some. But majority of our cloud orders enterprise cloud provider service providers these are relationships dialogue conversations we have regularly. So we have no reason to believe at this point that there's double booking going on of any kind. There could be a minor percentage but nothing major. In terms of durability again our customers are planning for a 1- to 2-year horizon. So I believe the durability of our orders in this 1- to 2-year horizon is strong. Of course there's always a risk that the orders are cancelable and they may make changes. But for most part they've stayed committed to us and we have seen them be consistent in wanting to get our product and willing to wait for it. So durability and authenticity is good.: Yes. And on lead times it really varies by product and it varries by decommits right now. So we thought we were doing super well and we were â€“ I was king of the jungle and on top of the line if you asked us this last November. But I think things have degraded for all our peers and for us. So lead are definitely measured in many weeks and many months.: We strive to execute better and I think we have done better than our competitors and we hope we continue to do so. What we don't do is promise one lead time and then come up with another at least not intentionally.: They do try. I have had a number of enterprise customers come to us and say """"I got all of this I can give to you if you can ship now."""" But again we're not able to ship now either. So much as they try the best we can do is face some kind of use cases for them in different products. But it isn't the case of direct substitution. It's a case of switching from one vendor to another and still having a plan across a period of time.: I think it's simply worth it George. I've seen a few of these in my career. And the first thing you do here is you really procure your newest products your components that are least likely to get obsolete. And I think we've been very smart and sensible about it. Second thing is don't confuse purchase commitments with purchase arrivals. They've not arrived yet. They're going to take multiple quarters or years to arrive. So think of this as a multiyear purchase commitment that could arrive in '22 '23 or in some cases '24. And the third thing is we look at this as a wise investment for a lot of common components that will be in our new products as well. So all in all no regrets. There may be some perturbation on some components that arrive and don't arrive but we feel good about this being one of our best investments for the short and long term.: Regarding pushout we'd rather they don't. We don't want that safety valve at the moment. So most of the orders in the semiconductor industry if you have been working around them are generally noncancelable but they can be managed from a time basis point of view.: Yes. No I think they are both good questions James. I'll take the first one. Noncancelable orders are easier said than done because they're based on contractual terms. So where we can do it we will look at that. But generally speaking we have long-term contracts. And in terms of -- what was the other question?: Right. Pricing and one the impact of pricing? Or what was the question again?: I think yes. James I think the key word is not pull in but better planning. So they are obviously looking at their purchases. When the lead times are 6 weeks they could look at this year this year and not worry about next year. So -- but now they're having to consider their budgets and their plans for not only this year but next year. So I -- so definitely I think you're seeing the demand of not just this year but as Anshul often likes to say this year has an extra quarter maybe 2. So from that point of view I think they are planning longer term.: Tom it's definitely work in progress. We could do better here. I would classify our software in sort of 3 buckets. The perpetual licenses that are very important that go with our products and we continue to be strong there. These could be routing licenses automation licenses analytics et cetera. Then as you call them the subscription revenue. And as I've often alluded to we don't just take our business and make it subscription. These are generally new businesses like DANZ Monitoring Fabric observability the AVA sensors for threat hunting CloudVision for network-as-a-service. And they're doing well but the revenue trails the bookings as you know. They're multiyear subscriptions. And this is still small for us. And so these 2 buckets together can be viewed as something that's in the 10% range that we would like to double in the next few years right? And then there's the services bucket. When you do really well on product the service percentages that you saw this year -- this quarter can get smaller. Q4 tends to be our strongest services and renewals bucket and that tends to be typically in the mid-teens to sometimes high teens. So these 3 are really our recurring and software components and they're very important but they tend to dwarf when your product is terribly strong like it is this year.",0.002740373,0.002967834,0.000225824
192,192,LHX,Kubasik,: Yeah. And just to -- on the Commercial Aviation we're right about $500 million of revenue this year is the outlook pre-pandemic that was in the $900 million range for our commercial training business. So we're continuing to be patient and take advantage of the rebound which should be coming soon. We had previously divested the military training so 900 to 500 there. And I'll just foot stomp the space business is really doing well well over $2 billion of revenue double-digit growth. And I just think we're in the sweet spot whether it's prime in these responsive space opportunities such as SDA and HBTSS that we've talked about some classified opportunities GPS and the MTS3 which is the next generation of GPS the weather satellites I mentioned but also the exquisite satellites where we are a sub to other companies and provide our payload. So we're going to take this work each and every time. Might be a little headwind on the margins but it positions us long term for growth and follow-on opportunities.: Yeah. Michael that's a great question on the legacy systems. I think we're all learning if the system is out of production now I think it's almost impossible to restart some of these weapon systems that you read and hear about having been in production for a decade. So being able to restart something I think is difficult. It's something that's currently operational but maybe an older version or something I think those are going to be easier to deploy. Again with the supply chain headwind I think that is going to be the challenge. I don't think anyone in the industry has a lot of these products lying around in their warehouses. We look for demand signals and contracts. Now what we're seeing is the customer who's been depleting their inventory. So we're more in a restocking situation. So look I'm real optimistic about our international opportunities. I think we are unique relative to other companies because we have a combination of products and we use a global distribution network. And then we have our more traditional business development staff with in country executives in-focused countries about 10 focus countries. We're focused where we think these opportunities for growth are. So I'm increasingly optimistic about what we've done in international. It's a larger percentage of our company each and every quarter. I think this quarter maybe in the 23% range. So more to come. And now that COVID is easing a lot of us are going to be traveling around the globe more and more to continue to build these relationships and try to close deals. So with that let me just say first of all I appreciate the feedback on our new format. So I think we're going to do this again and continue to do it at least for the rest of the year and see if we can come up with something even more creative. I know our customers are under a lot of stress and we're all working in the industry to support our customers. I mentioned the Agile Development Group and Shield but this is a result of listening to our customer and hearing what they want and then taking action. So a lot of this I have to credit our customers for saying they want new entrants. They want innovation. They want to work with Silicon Valley type companies. So we're trying to adapt to that. And of course I have to thank the employees the dedication the hard work the innovative spirit. It's all inspiring. I feel like we've got a lot of momentum a lot of excitement and really looking forward to wrapping up a solid 2022. I will just say in closing that we'll continue our humanitarian efforts for the people Ukraine. We'll keep working with DoD NATO allies and others to support this mission and deal with the conflict at hand. So thank you for joining the call and we'll wrap up a little earlier than normal. Have a great weekend. And talk to you in a couple of months. Bye.,0.017843336,0.032073557,0.014230222
193,193,APO,Rowan:,Look itâ€™s Marc Iâ€™ll start with the balance sheet and then weâ€™ll talk about origination. So as Scott mentioned in the call when Athene or quite frankly any other retirement services company assumes a liability it matches it with assets and we so-called AOM matching. There is a portion of that that needs to be reinvested over a period of time representing the profit on the contract. When people talk about AOM matching they are talking about matching an asset and the liability but profit to some extent is unhedged and therefore if you are putting assets on the books in a rate environment that are higher than the rate environment when you assume the liability that is generally a positive. In addition what weâ€™ve seen is a benefit from floating rate. Now your specific question as it relates to origination generally what we have seen is the â€“ at the newly underwritten product is being underwritten in the context of higher rates and yet our funding cost on these platforms are relatively sticky so weâ€™ve seen expanding margins across the platform. To the extent rising rates and just to give you a sense in the â€“ through I guess the last week the investment-grade market was off 17%. Itâ€™s made people gunshot and weâ€™ve seen this across most public credit markets to the extent there is dislocation in public credit markets we are a better more secure more definite source of capital. All of those things benefit on average we are better off with rising rates.Letâ€™s do it at the highest level and just to give you â€“ itâ€™s Marc by the way context from the Investor Day. We said at Investor Day that we expect to generate $15 billion of excess capital over the next five years. $5 billion to support what weâ€™ll call the base dividend $5 billion for investment in the business and $5 billion that we would use opportunistically either to invest or for buybacks or for dividends I think Martin said it best given where the stock is we expect to use a portion of that to buy back stock. The stock is very attractive from our point of view. Now one needs to actually generate the $5 billion to be able to spend it but one can argue that probably the highest and best use of our excess capital is our own stock.Look I think you are going to see the product set have immediate distribution placements. Some will be directly into wire houses some will be directly to RIA. And I think the thing I want to make sure I communicate is a view that â€“ we really we view this as really the first inning. Whatâ€™s happened to-date across the entirety of our industry has been the repurposing of existing products for this channel at institutional fees. The next phase of this is products created specifically for this marketplace that deal with the unique needs of this marketplace diversification no J curve no double fees no capital cost semi liquid full alignment. Thatâ€™s where we believe this market is going and again Iâ€™ll come back. We have as alternative managers often talked about our business in historical context where we are in the small alternative bucket be it private equity and a number of things like it. At our Investor Day we sought to broaden that definition to show you that we view alternatives particularly in the yield marketplace to include investment grade. I believe the way we think about the product and the way we communicate the product is investors have had a relatively benign experience over the past decade against the backdrop of money printing which has existed since 2008 and falling rates. On a go-forward basis to the extent the market does not look like that I believe that there will â€“ investors will be challenged and will be revisiting in wholesale the notion of 60-40 40-60 portfolio. Our ambition is not to just serve a traditional alternatives bucket it is to serve stable value investment grade total return opportunistic REIT BDC hedge and equity and to offer a complete alternatives ecosystem guided by the notion of excess return per unit of risk.Yeah. Thatâ€™s exactly the point. These platforms are businesses that â€“ that are producing origination flow for the underlying retirement services fixed income portfolio and then the equity of those platforms are whatâ€™s in the alternatives portfolio. As those businesses continue to grow as we continue to invest in those platforms you are seeing just pretty stable scaling earnings growth in those platforms. You can see as some of the trends weâ€™ve highlighted a few on Page 16 of the earnings slides.So itâ€™s Marc Iâ€™ll start and then Iâ€™ll hand it to Scott. All I can say is yes. I know that thatâ€™s not clarity but recall how â€“ in Investor Day how we based our business. Weâ€™ve set out a five year plan which includes raising a total of â€“ having total AUM of roughly $50 billion at retail over the five year period. I believe that target is a very conservative target and I am optimistic on our chances to be able to exceed that. How the market develops? I think we have to have some bit humility in looking forward. Product launches are notoriously complicated and we will see broad market acceptance. If you ask us for opinion I think the market will be in the short-term high net worth. It will be balanced between or the competing traditional definition of alternatives as well as newer definition of alternatives. And it is our job to differentiate our products on the competitive marketplace around the way we offer these products the creativity with which we offer these products the alignment that we will have with retail investors around these products. And as Scott mentioned purchase price matters. To the extent we have a vision of alternatives making up a much larger portion of a portfolio that will necessarily include the expanded definition of alternatives and consumers be they high net worth or otherwise we will need to see all that they are making secure choices and not buying just volatility.Yeah yeah look this goes back to purchase price matters right. Our PE business has built its portfolio along the lines of acquiring good cash flowing businesses where we can drive real tangible value to those businesses through earnings growth through cost savings through cash flow. And so and not really dependent on rising valuations to get out at meaningfully higher values than where you entered. So in Q1 we saw exactly that notwithstanding inflation that is very real in the economy. Wage inflation and materials inflation logistics inflation the underlying strengths of the underlying businesses allowed for price increases to continue to offset that inflation and continue to grow output. So I mean thatâ€™s the fundamental strategy that Apollo has been pursuing for the last decade. It hasnâ€™t been sexy over the last decade but certainly as we enter this new economic regime change where you canâ€™t just rely on declining or 0% rates to allow you to exit at ever increasing multiples. This is exactly the type of performance I would expect to be seeing in this type of environment.So this is Marc why donâ€™t I start and then Iâ€™ll hand it to Martin. And I hate to be somewhat financially oriented about this. But when Athene or any other retirement services company takes on a liability it matches it with a portfolio of assets. 94% 95% of those assets are fixed income and 4% 5% 6% of those assets are alternative in a nomenclature. We can debate whether they are alternatives and which definition implies but call them equity. As a quirk of accounting in the insurance industry fixed income for certainly for regulatory purposes and otherwise is generally held at market assuming it held at book held at cost. And the reason for that is simple. Movements in interest rates really assets and liabilities almost equally. And while in some instances you end up showing the mark the economics and the substance of the underlying is you are putting an asset a liability matched on to a book over an 8 10 12 15 year period. What happens in any one quarter is actually not really all that relevant. We recorded because thatâ€™s what GAAP asks us to do equity is marked on a quarterly basis. So we show you both. We show you what actually havenâ€™t and then we show you what we think of on a normalized basis which is how we underwrite to make our spreads work we assume that we will earn 11% over a very long period of time from this portfolio and we provide you the metrics to judge whether or not we in fact are earning 11% over a long period of time against this portfolio but truly what happens on a quarterly basis is just not that relative.Yes yes sure. So as we look at we are actively monetizing Fund IX and Fund VIII quite frankly. The Q2 monetizations get â€“ given some of the volatility will probably look a lot like Q1 but based on some sale processes some signed sale agreements some signed dividend recap and distribution agreements expect to see it stepping up in the back half of the year. And as these investments progress â€˜23 and â€˜24 are the big harvest years for this fund. So thatâ€™s what the timeline looks like. Obviously as we get out into those years market conditions will apply is it going to skew more towards public or private exit spots. You can see by the returns value was creating incredibly nicely in that portfolio. Again not dependent on big multiple uplift but on real earnings growth. So feel quite good about that over the next couple of years.Yes yes look interest rate interest costs are just less relevant to our portfolio than to many of our peers. Remember we created Fund IX at an average even a multiple of about 6.5x right thatâ€™s the leverage level for many of our peers. At the average leverage level is somewhere a little under four times. So rising rates are interesting but they are super impactful to the return performance of the portfolio. On average we are about 50-50 fixed and floating across the portfolio. We are starting to move a little more fixed but again like I said in the five things that our deal teams think about interest rates are number seven. Itâ€™s just not particularly relevant to the total returns.Yes. So look thatâ€™s been the topic of a lot of conversation over the last few months. But frankly not just in our equity portfolio but across the entire platform. Back in March of 2020 we did something â€“ we created what we call the common lens where we created a series of scenarios that we asked all our businesses from our equity businesses our hybrid businesses our yield businesses our retirement service platforms to really model their businesses across these various scenarios so that we can start taking a collective look at the risk and opportunities in our business. We have again recently done so with some of the recent economic changes that weâ€™ve all been talking about. And that scenario does show obviously rising rates for sure but then how does that end? What type of either economic slowdowns or actual recessions we are modeling in. So the firm is looking at those scenarios and modeling on a very conservative footing when it comes to the course of 2022 and into 2023.So Glenn itâ€™s Marc. Iâ€™ll start at a high level. First I will tell you we intend to announce a day in the near future where we will do a complete balance sheet tutorial for people across Athene and the broader credit business. So that those new â€“ newer to the story can understand exactly how we proceed. We start with a notion that we generally want to be top of the capital structure and investment grade. When we started Athene back in 2008 2009 it was relatively easy to source that in the marketplace. The markets were chaotic. Recall things like TALF and TARP and other nice initials. Very quickly as the markets heal themselves it became clear to us that we needed to be an originator of credit. We have referred to our business as fixed income replacement. We are generally a replacement for investment-grade fixed income. We are generally top of the capital structure. We are generally senior secured. We do not think a retirement services business or a fixed income replacement portfolio of an institution is a place to take credit risk for equity risk. The risk we see to take is liquidity risk or structure risk. We can afford to be less liquid because our liabilities are less liquid and the liabilities of sovereign wealth funds pension funds and otherwise. And so I step back and I think about the marketplace today and I look at the various alternatives and think about where I would want to be if I were negatively biased. I generally want to be in floating rate. But why we have a lot of that? I generally want to be top of the capital structure with good spread. We have a lot of that. I would probably not want to be subordinated and fixed rate. Thatâ€™s not where we are. The business that we have built is a fixed income replacement business. That is not to say there are not other good businesses. But it is a very different business than our peer set for better or worse. In some markets peers may perform better. In a market like this purchase price matters being the top of the capital structure matters being senior secured matters and I think we will fair very well. The stress test which as you know our industry does not publish we run the Fed CCAR we publish it. We run our risk appetite we publish it. We run Lehman we publish it. We will do our best to educate the investor universe that what the risk we are taking is liquidity risk and structure risk and not credit risk.,0.002703249,0.003085852,0.00021924
194,194,HLT,Nassetta:,Yes. I think at a high level Smedes the way I think about Europe is Europe is recovering quite nicely not Eastern Europe but the bulk of our business in Europe is driven by Western Europe. And Europe is not quite as far along as the United States but has been motoring along. Kevin gave you a few of the stats that I think support that. So we expect like the U.S. Europe -- Western Europe to continue to recover. Our expectation is Eastern Europe for the foreseeable future is going to be quite challenged. But again a very very small insignificant part of the portfolio being impacted by that. And China obviously a more complex situation. We have a view. We have forecast which is why we can build it in and give guidance. I think our expectation is in the second half of the year as China goes through a process of locking down some of the major cities and then reopening them that China is going to reopen for China at a minimum. Not necessarily China opening for international arrivals. But as we saw in the early stages of the pandemic when China got way ahead of the rest of the world when China opens for China in China business our business does quite well and can recover very very rapidly. So our expectation is second half of the year you will see China start to reopen really with more benefit in the fourth quarter and into next year than in the third quarter.Booking windows are extending as you might guess. I think within 7 days it's now -- it had gotten to be a vast majority at the worst of COVID was booked within 7 days. I think we're approaching in April 50-50 plus or minus like 50% of the business within 7 days 50% longer. So huge huge improvement from where we were.75% direct. We didn't give an OTA percentage we typically wouldn't. But we're in sort of the pre-pandemic we were in the very low teens which is what we sort of believe the efficient frontier is for the business to be able to drive the best results for our ownership community. And I would say in the quarter we're basically there plus or minus.We didn't. I think the answer to the first question is yes. I do think '23 will be back at -- for group will be back at '19 levels. We did not give a stat. I think the stat from the best of my memory is about 15% down versus '19 at the moment for '23. But as I articulated in the prepared comments our sales folks can hardly keep up with all the leads that are coming in for the second half of this year and particularly into next year. And so I think just given the trajectory of how this recovery has occurred and what we've seen sort of in the year for the year business. I wouldn't read a whole lot into being 15 down for next year. We have plenty of time to book that. And importantly the rates are basically low double digits at the moment. The book business is low double digit higher than '19. And so part of what we're obviously trying to do is maximize the outcome rate flows really nicely for our ownership community. So we're not -- we really don't want to rush too much in this kind of inflationary environment because we know the business is going to be there and we want to put it on the books at the highest rates possible. And so we're sort of taking our time and metering it out. I suspect as I said next year we will be at volumes similar to 2019 when we're done with 2023 and at rates much higher than 2019.We -- yes I mean I'd say first on the labor front there are still significant issues that we're seeing both in what we manage and as we talk to our franchise community what they're seeing. Over the last 6 months we've seen a very significant increase in labor coming back into the labor force and our ability to get folks in the hotels which obviously are needed given the demand profile and the increases in demand across all segments as I already described. So we're not all the way anywhere near where we want to be but the issues are not -- they're not as extreme as they had been at other points in the pandemic including recently. In terms of customer satisfaction I think listen I think all service industries have suffered and we're right there along with the rest of them. We've been intensely monitoring and we have all sorts of ways to do that both through social but our own tracking systems that we call self satisfaction and loyalty tracking. And what I've seen is those numbers that had sort of bottomed out in the middle of the pandemic have started to come back and go the other way as we've been able to get labor and bring some of the services back. Our social scores I think the last I saw lead the industry and have been moving up in a positive way. So we have -- we're not satisfied with what we're doing right now. I think the team sitting at this table would say I've been pounding the table a lot. We like what we're doing. We're on a good trajectory. We need to get more labor back in. We need to restore more services get food and beverage back on track and other services. And we're obviously sensitive -- very sensitive as you sort of implied in your question to the cost structure for our owner community. But the reality is the demand is there and we're charging for it. So we have to deliver the experience or ultimately we're going to impair our ability to continue to drive rate if we don't deliver the basic experience. So I'm confident we will our owner community broadly. You talk to a lot of them but I talk to tons of them. They're broadly understanding of it. They're supportive. They're seeing the pricing pressure and they realize that we have to work together to get there. We have been -- as I mentioned in my earlier response we have been super crazy focused on making sure that when we get to the other side of this this is a better setup for our owner community than what we had before the pandemic. And we continue to work really hard on that and we're confident on a comparable basis that they will be in a better place and that inflation is their friend it's our friend and the cost savings and initiatives that we -- that we pursued and implemented during COVID are going to pay dividends for a long time to come.Yes. I've been doing this a long time and we've been studying this a long time and in fact got our team to update R Squared on this just so we could be technically accurate I like numbers. And the reality is if you go back over long periods of history there is not a very high R square. There is not a very high correlation. In fact there's a very low correlation between what's going on with fuel prices and demand in our business. You can go back to like the '08 '09 when oil hit 150-plus a barrel and we went looked at all those periods. And there's not a very high correlation. I think it has a lot to do with the consumer psychology which at the moment there are certainly lots of fears and uncertainty about where the world goes. But at the moment as I said the consumer has an abundant amount of savings as do businesses and a burning desire to sort of get out there and do business and/or experience the world having been locked up a lot more than they would have liked to. So we're not really seeing any of it. Now there's also a phenomenon that is we'll shift around but if you looked at our business prepandemic sort of roughly 2/3 of the business 60% to 2/3 were fly to and the rest were drive to. That's flipped around during the pandemic. And it's still disproportionately the majority right now even with where we are in recovery are people driving. So part of this is there's -- now gas prices are going up too but maybe not proportionately as much as the airline ticket is. So there is a little bit of a substitution effect that I suspect is going on with people deciding they'll drive a little further right? They kind of got used to COVID like hey it might have been a 2- or 3-hour sort of limit before and now it's a 5- 6- 7-hour limit for what they're willing to endure to drive. And so it's a long-winded way of saying we have not seen resistance and we do not in looking at very detailed analysis of R Squares we do not historically see a lot of high correlation.And if you look at the regions of the world I mean the U.S. has always been a predominantly sort of franchise-oriented environment. If you look at our makeup here it's a majority -- vast majority of its franchise. 10 years ago there was no franchising going on in Europe. Today they is. So we have a much more sort of blended approach. It's like 50-50. If you went to Asia Pacific five years ago 7 years ago it was 0 franchise. Now franchising is particularly in China is growing and it's an opportunity for us particularly with mid-market brands to be able to create a network effect much much faster. And we feel super confident in our ability to manage a franchise system. I don't think there's anybody better in terms of delivering great product and great service to customers. So it's driven a lot by sort of the owner desires and sort of the evolution of the business around the world as different parts of the world mature.Go ahead.Thank you Chad and thank you all for joining us today. I think you could probably hear the enthusiasm in our voice. It's been quite a couple of years but I do believe that the decisions we made the actions we took during the pandemic have put Hilton in the best position it's ever been in from the standpoint of driving performance margins driving free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders in the years to come. We're super excited about what we think is going to play out for the rest of the year and we'll look forward after the second quarter to updating you on that progress. Thanks again for the time today.,0.191240585,0.944711804,0.376735649
195,195,SYY,Hourican:,Morning Ed. Thank you for the questions. Kevin. I'll start with fill rates. My language that are used in prepared remarks is we're performing better than the industry average and that is the most accurate descriptor of our performance. We are below our historical fill rate standards. We set a very high bar for ourselves on ship on time and ship in full and we are below our historical standards. The why is our inbound fill rate from our suppliers to us is well below our historical standards. Our output to our customers is actually significantly higher than the inbound fill rate to Sysco and the how and why behind that is the work we do to find substitutes to bridge customers to alternative products and that's what's creating the relative strength of Sysco versus others is the good work our merchant teams are doing to find product substitutions. I think your question is more like is there even more sales to be had for fill rates improve? I would say yes. How long it will take for fill rate to improve is subject for debate. So what we're doing because we want to take ownership of what we can directly control is to be even better at managing fill rate. So we're improving our website to provide dynamic visibility to out-of-stocks and provide suggestions at point-of-sale to the customer on things that can be bought alternatively and our sales teams and merchandising teams when we find ourselves as I mentioned earlier in a situation of long-term outs are being very proactive providing quick selling bulletins to our sales teams digital marketing pushes to our customers including emails on suggesting to them alternatives in the likes. It's a core strength of our Company. I meaningfully desire for the inbound fill rate to Sysco to improve are working very closely with our suppliers on that and we think it will improve but not quickly. It's going to be a sequential steady slow improvement in fill rate into our fiscal 2023. As it relates to volume in the second part of your question what I would say is we expect that the end of our fiscal Q3 to be back to 2019 from a volume perspective and we have the segments that will be at that level in Q2 of this fiscal year. Within our existing fiscal year we will be back to 2019 volume levels. I'm not going to break it down by sector it's not something I'm prepared to do this morning. But go ahead please back to you.Total Company. All Sysco combined at the end of our Q3 will be at 2019 volume levels.Thank you Ed.Good morning John. This is Kevin. The predominant reason for the market share capture is net new customers serve at Sysco both at the national and local level. So we're winning more new business than at any other point in time in Company history. The why breaks down to 2 pretty fundamentally basic things. First is the compensation model that we changed as you know June of last year. We're now compensating our associates to be more prospecting versus cultivating and that is paying dividends. So they drive the behaviors that we expect and we're seeing significant benefit in dividend from rewarding those associates for the good work they're doing in winning new business. The second reason is the supply chain health. We have customers almost on a daily basis large and small coming to us and asking for Sysco to take on their business. I won't name the State but we had a very large education customer come to us this week actually and say we're not getting the support we need and can Sysco take on our business and we're finalizing the details of the contract which is why I'm not going to quote the where but we expect that business to come on board by January 1. So that is a signal of our strength the confidence that large and small customers have in our ability to ship on time in full at rates greater than the market. Jon specifically what competitors segment that's coming from I think it's all the above. But stronger players with broader access to inventory clearly performing well. Back to prove that point we have more inventory on-hand at this moment in time than we did pre-COVID. So are there select product shortages? Yes. But we've been able to invest in inventory. We have more inventory on hand than pre-COVID and our staffing levels are where we need them to be but every time we bring on more people our demand increases and then we have to go hire even more people which is proving that there's continued runway this was Aaron's point a moment ago on our ability to grow our topline. As we continue to make progress on our staffing in through put capacity. John back to you for any follow-up.John what we've articulated is we're really bullish on our EBIT margin expanding that we will move that needle. I do not believe that that growth will come primarily from product margin expansion. It's going to come from continued disciplined expense optimization by taking structural cost out and investing in capabilities that drive the top line. So while the EBIT margin grows as A the top line will be accelerating B we'll be taking structural cost out of the business and those two levers in combination is what expands the EBIT margin. But sales growth and cost reductions; not for margin rate growth. Aaron I'll toss to you for any additional comments. I would just add in supporting Kevin's point that I am also excited by elements of our merchandising in our supply chain transformation that over time as we work through this very inflationary period should provide us with opportunities and particular I'm excited with work that is underway in connection with Sysco's private label brands and other elements that will be supportive of our overall financial profile. To answer your question while the short-term certainly were challenged or it's lower than we would have hoped from a gross margin perspective because of the impact inflation over the longer-term the '24 'the 25 [Indiscernible]Thanks John.Nicole it's a great question and you're right that my recent narrative of our pricing software has been about managing inflation. It's just because of the unprecedented environment that we're currently in double-digit inflation is unique and what the tools helping us in the current period is being very strategic and thoughtful about how to pass through that inflation in a responsible way and being confident that when we make those decisions that they're executed well. We used to do that work manually through a large sales force we can now do that through a strategic pricing office and when we make the decision it's executed immediately. Then we can monitor the impact of those decisions and update it on a daily basis if need be. So the reason for my narrative on inflation is just because of the environment we're in. For the longer term the goal of the pricing project is to be a pricing system excuse me is to move to a strategic price optimization. I'm not going to name the category because I don't want to telegraph it but we've got select categories where we are above-market from a pricing perspective we make decent very high-quality margins and we're going to run price optimization tests. If we lower slightly our prices in that category. Does the sales growth more than offset the margin dilution? With a pricing software you can do test versus control geography-based tests to optimize for the right price and how I've described that work is the following. We will make investments in certain items that are key value items KVIs and we will raise prices nominally in the tail of the inventory SKU which is less visible to the customers which therefore results in flattish margin rates by growing top line as my term is right unpriced at the item customer level which allows us to win more market shares. That's the longer-term goal of the projects. However this system has been extremely useful during this early part of our fiscal 2022 and how we manage inflation.Yeah retention is extraordinarily important to our staffing health and during the first quarter of this fiscal year we were extremely focused on hiring because again the winning of the new business that we've been able to post over the last 2 years requires us to continue to increase our throughput capacity. We are spending an extensive amount of time on improving retention. Retention is lower than historical run rate averages to answer your question but it's getting better as we are putting even more focus on retention. The most important population for us is our driver population. I's a highly skilled job. It's our customer facing role and one of the investments that we've made Aaron and I together is in a driver retention bonus. We paid it in Q1 we're going to pay it again in Q2 and that retention bonus for our drivers is working. It had a noticeable and visible positive impact on retention and that's the type of investment that I referred to as a transitory type investment. We will do that investment for as long as it takes but we do expect as we improve our overall staffing health that the need for those types of investments will go down and here's why overtime rates are running very high currently at Sysco versus our historical standards. I called that out in my prepared remarks. Over time is actually the thing that drives our retention down. If we're spending or excuse me providing our associates too much overtime daily. We're working extremely aggressively to boost our staffing troops such that we can have overtime back to historical standards and that will improve retention. It also Improving the P&L because overtime rates are pretty punitive to the overall P&L and I called that out in my prepared remarks where I said our second half of this fiscal year we should expect to see improvements in overtime reductions in some of the transitory expenses that I stated which will help the P&L. Aaron to you for any further comments?Thank you Nicole.So far no.We've proven that a mom-and-pop independent restaurant operate similar to a consumer and retail they decide based on value they decide based on price they decide based on services that you mentioned a moment ago. The value in the unlock of the loyalty program that we're building is making that customer specific what the offers are to them and making it indelibly clear to them the value that's being brought to them by Sysco. We're going to talk about more in the future because it's in pilot as we speak and we'd like to have actual factual results before we talk about things publicly. We're very pleased with the initial progress steps forward in our loyalty program. We are building the data and the plumbing from an IT perspective to execute against that effort nationwide and we are piloting it currently in select geographies and we will refine it optimize it iterated but it will be similar to the types of loyalty programs that you're familiar with as a customer. The data is in the cloud we're able to use machine learning to optimize against the data and yes there are value-added services that we will provide for those customers that are part of the program that they will be able to take advantage of to improve their business results and outcome. So we're excited about it we're bullish on it and we'll talk more about it in future quarters.I think Aaron described it very well. I think the punch line is we're ahead of schedule on that activity which is why Aaron updated our guidance on when we would begin to stock buyback to this quarter.Happy to. Let me give you some visibility to what's in our bucket of step back and it is things like retention programs hiring bonuses sign-on bonuses the incremental recruiting support for the massive hiring we're doing right now. The incremental marketing third party contractors we're bringing into help on a temporary basis relative to staffing. Those things are transitory onetime while Q1 Q2 but are not permanent cost structures. What's not in there for instance is increased overtime costs. That's not one time but we also have the opportunity to bring it down over time and are actively working that. So now you have a sense of what's in the bucket. Why do I have confidence that we can address it over time. It's two-fold first is we got started early relative to cost-down efforts and so to a degree we put some money in the bank in advance of need and that effort will continue as we carry forward. Second element as you heard Kevin and I alluded to this earlier the benefit of all the investment we're doing against our supply chain transformation is incremental productivity which helps us to manage the overall cost structure as we carry forward and finally if I can add one which is just the nature of the categories I called out they are by definition onetime or transitory.Yeah Jeff. The 1.2 statement is specifically tied to Technomic's data. We get that data from them once per quarter and that is a data point that I can only report upon once per quarter as a result of that. We can see on a weekly monthly-basis our relative growth. We can generally see the markets relative growth through other sources of data but once per quarter we get the legitimate data feed from Technomic and that is where that data comes from.Jeffrey the punch line is we are confident that we can pass on the inflation. However an editorial comment and then I'm going to provide some color comments. We don't think that double-digit inflation in perpetuity is good for the industry. It's not something we desire it's not something we accept and we're working very aggressively to push back on cost increases find alternative suppliers find alternative items that can lower the net landing cost for our customers and we do believe that inflation will begin tapering. It's just going to take longer to begin tapering than what we originally expected back at the beginning of the year which Aaron talked about accurately and clearly during his narrative. But with that said we are not experiencing push back from our customers. The primary reason is end consumers aren't slowing down in their consumption of food away from home in fact the opposite is true. We continue to see sequential improvement in our overall results tied to volume growth and also obviously inflation at high levels just to call out with their specificity. What we do with our customers we have built a proprietary inflation tool calculator where we can take a inbound raw material to us that is significantly elevated from a cost perspective and we can highlight for our customers what items on their menu are directly impacted by that inflationary item to then suggest to them that type of menu price changes that they should make and that's what we mean with things like Value-Added Services and I'm not talking about an obvious thing like meat and poultry and talk about things like fats shortenings and oils are highly inflationary right now and there are many different products on a menu that are impacted by particular raw ingredient costs increase. Our sales reps have been trained and equipped to be able to work with our end customers to educate them that this raw materials is increased. Here's our suggesting to you on what you can do with your menu price and it's for that reason that our customers aren't pushing back to the degree that you might suspect externally because they view us as a partner and that's what we are. We're partnering with them to help them be successful and profitable and the good news for this industry is that the end consumer has remained robust and strong. Jeff back to you for any further comments.Okay. Thanks Jeff. Have a good day.This is Kevin just to bolster. We're not breaking it down by segment. We've been clear which segments remain behind. We have Travel and Hospitality Business and Industry as two notable examples that from a volume perspective remain down versus 19 levels. The good news is there's obviously significant offsets in strength within our restaurant sector specifically independent local sector which is our most profitable sector. So ultimately that's the ultimate positive strength here is that the restaurant in volume is the core strength at this point in time and as Aaron said the enterprise level will be at 19 levels by end of Q3.Yeah thank you. John asked a question earlier which are the primary drivers of the growth. Share of wallet has been steadily improving but it has not been the primary source of the growth. The primary source of the growth has been net new customer wins Kelly over the last let's call it two years. I believe that we'll pivot in the future where the personalization work pricing work we're doing the work we're going to do on the loyalty program that I alluded to earlier. We will pivot to more of the growth coming from increased share of wallet and mathematically it's why we are confident that we will go from the 1.2 times market growth that we're currently delivering to the 1.5 times growth which will be the growth target we have for the third year of our 3-year strategy that we call the recipe for growth. So the percent contribution of the growth will pivot more towards share of wallet in the coming fiscal years.Thanks Kelly.,0.004125163,0.005803943,0.001165894
196,196,ROK,Moret:,Yes. Thanks Jeff.Hey Josh.Yes. Itâ€™s in line with the idea that weâ€™ve talked about of accelerating profitable growth and we remain committed to the IDN or seeing this play out that nothing expands margins like top line growth. And so we think that weâ€™re striking a good balance between the near-term profitability and the investment to create an even brighter future.Josh itâ€™s supply chain constraints. Weâ€™ve got this enormous demand thatâ€™s a result I think of three basic things. First of all itâ€™s the secular trends that youâ€™re seeing play out across industries and geography placing a higher degree of importance on automation and digital transformation than ever before. So itâ€™s secular. Itâ€™s also cyclical. We are still early in what we believe is going to be a multi-year period of economic expansion. And then finally itâ€™s our position in this market. And I think all three of those things are driving the demand.Yes. And just a final point just to summarize fiscal 2022 sales would be higher were it not for the supply chain constraints. So weâ€™re managing as Nick said our capacity our labor based on very dynamic practices hand to hand around the world making sure that weâ€™re acquiring talent keeping talent paying competitive wages all those things weâ€™re keeping ahead of it.Yes. Thanks Josh.Yes. The other point I would just add is weâ€™ve continued to see this order momentum for multiple quarters now. And the trends are extending into January. So we see it again as reflective of underlying demand in multiple industries and we can point to the specific investments based on the large greenfields that have been announced as well as on the ground individual salespeople from distributors from our own people who are directly involved in these projects. So we feel very good about the overall demand.Thanks Julian.Hey Brendan.I think its new investment. I would not look at it as shifting manufacturing although I think manufacturing in North America is probably a larger percentage of a companyâ€™s global investment than it has been traditionally. So I donâ€™t see people closing plants in Asia for instance and bringing them back as the majority of whatâ€™s driving the demand. But I do see as people are planning new capacity whether itâ€™s brownfields or greenfields or upgrades adding digitization solutions to existing capacity. I see North America and that obviously is our strongest market as being an outsized beneficiary. So automation in general as I said before from a secular standpoint is increasing. Then in the cycle itâ€™s still early. And our position in high growth high investment areas of both geography and technology are positive in what are driving a lot of this outlook.Thanks Brendan.Hey Steve.No. There is no â€“Yes. And I would just say continued very strong backlog. So just a simple math of what we shipped and what we booked indicates the backlog remains and even grows. So that remains healthy.Yes. Thank you.Hey Andy.Sure. Just specifically on China if we look at the verticals that contributed to that strong double-digit growth there was a Tire which in general of course continues to be a great vertical and thereâ€™s a lot of tire activity complementing the EV activity going on in China and weâ€™re a beneficiary of that. Food and Beverage is an area where that worldwide is our single biggest vertical. And weâ€™ve had some great recent traction within China in Food and Beverage Chemical and then Mass Transit. So these are industries that have generally been pretty good for us in China. And when I talk about new ways to get to market itâ€™s really complementing our traditional distribution. But weâ€™ve also given our local leadership more empowerment to make investments that they say are appropriate with our relatively lower share in China. We think by doing basic things correctly thereâ€™s lots of room to run. And itâ€™s a combination of our core products as well as the new ways to win Information Solutions & Connected Services. And those are really seen as a calling card getting into customers even when their installed base might be with competitive product itâ€™s a way for engaging high level decision makers as we bring that new value to them. And those companies across Food and Beverage and Life Sciences and EV theyâ€™re all intensely interested in climbing the productivity curve fast. And so thatâ€™s where we see particular endorsement of our software which is a strong contributor in China as well as new disruptive technology like independent card which we continue to win some very large orders in China based on independent card particularly in EV and battery assembly.Thanks Andy.,0.002516508,0.002564132,4.76E-05
197,197,MSCI,-,Andy Wiechmann: Yes yes sure. So I would point out and make sure you keep in mind that there is some seasonality on the legacy real estate business where some revenues are recognized based on deliveries of service which tend to be heavier weighted in Q1 and Q2. So if you look in the past you will tend to see margins being slightly higher in those quarters and so there's some continuing contribution from that granted it's smaller in the absolute basis because of RCA being in there. To your point there are a number of moving pieces on the integration which will cause the expenses to be non-linear. At this point we're still working towards that mid-teens EBITDA margin for the year. Although there are a number of variable as it could cause it to be slightly higher potentially slightly lower not only related to integration but also the pace of capitalizations. So there are certain expenses that we're finding we can capitalize a bit more. But I'd say it's too early in the year for us to change that mid-teens figure although it could have some variability around it.Andy Wiechmann: Yeah you know I would generalize it across all of our products that insurance is a exciting client opportunity for us and a segment where it's historically been less significant and so it cuts across many of our product areas on the analytic side given the investments we've made and enhancements we've made to our fixed income analytics. We have a much more compelling solution to insurance companies within ESG and Climate. You know we have some as you know very differentiated insights and content that are extremely relevant to insurers who are trying to assess not only the impact of ESG and Climate within their investment portfolios but also the general accounts at the organizations and for obvious reasons Climate is something that is very relevant to insurers and there's potential regulations around peak-half [ph] that could drive strong demand for some of our solutions there. And then on the index side especially around some of our investment thesis indexes particularly those with ESG and Climate angles are very compelling across a number of insurance use cases including index linked variable annuities. And so it's a segment that we're very focused on. We've got a clear opportunity and it's a matter of just executing against it.Henry Fernandez: Baer you want to take that one?Henry Fernandez: Yes so weâ€™re very excited about the work that we're doing there in two fronts. The listed futures and options opportunity continues to expand as we have been showing in the last few quarters and the use cases the licensing of new use cases is also expanded so most of this the futures and options that we have are on market cap indices. So we are now looking to our â€“ with our partners the exchange [ph] partners to do a whole generation of climate and ESG aligned indices for the productions and features and I think that will put another layer of growth in this area in addition to the continued expansion of the market cap indices for listed futures and options. The second category which is what â€“ you know what Andy alluded to which is reported in the index subscription line or area is the structured products over the counter options you know flaps and all of that that area is growing significantly for us not only on the market cap indices but especially on new investment thesis indices ESG and Climate being in that category but also thematic indices and therefore that is an area that we're putting up a lot of effort and that normally translated into sometimes you know one-time fees so these are recurring one-time fees that show up in Index and the Index description they don't show up in the asset base fees at this point. So we are very excited about that and that is a major area of expansion that we see in the next few years.,0.002850533,0.002966046,0.000115514
198,198,ROST,Hartshorn:,California was relatively in line with the chain. And then -- of our bigger markets which you mentioned Texas and Florida.On dd's -- dd's did trail Ross but they were up against stronger gains last year especially with the government stimulus that has an outsized impact on that consumer and also last year's stimulus with -- at their income levels they were also more impacted by inflation than the Ross customer.Sure. We -- it's best to start from last year. So last year the lead times degradated as we moved through the year. So they got longer. So we planned the year based on what we saw in the fourth quarter. And what we saw in the first quarter is it did ease somewhat which meant we received goods early. Expectations for going forward I think weâ€™ll be highly dependent on how China comes back from their shutdown. So we're watching that very closely. We're going to be very cautious with our lead times. But I think it's going to be dependent on whether -- when they open back up and the timing of when it opens back up what type of congestion that causes?I think what we're saying is we know we can do better. So in this environment inflationary environment -- I mean none of us have been in this for 40 years. So we know we can offer our customer better bargains and we'll do that. So it's -- we wouldn't be able to break out execution versus the impact on inflation in the consumer.,0.002833784,0.002833784,0
199,199,DOW,Fitterling:,Yes. Good question. Natural gas has been stubbornly high. It was higher than last year before the Russian-Ukraine incident and then obviously then that drove it quite a bit higher. I would say the biggest issue behind natural gas pricing in the near term has been freeze-offs in the U.S. and the fact that we've not been back to the 98 Bcf a day that we need to produce at to get inventories back to the 5-year level. We've only been running about 95 Bcf per day so we're about 3 Bcf a day short to get those inventories back to that level. Some of that has been due to freeze-offs through the winter and just not a big rebound. But we're starting to see the production and the rigs shift into natural gas production. And what's going to happen I think is that natural gas production is going to come on faster than any LNG export capability. We're pretty well maxed out on LNG export capability today. So we'll -- if we can get these inventories back to the 5-year average levels by the fall then I think you're going to see natural gas prices really come back into a more normal trading range. In the medium term I'd say they get back to $4 to $6 1 million Btu longer term as those inventories get to that 5-year level around $3 1 million Btu. And then I think you'll see how many new export facilities get put up and also how much new import capability in Europe gets added to be able to decouple them from the Russian situation. I think natural gas is going to see more investment and has a more positive outlook in the near term than oil. Oil has not had the investment for new capacity for the last several years. And if we were back to the level that oil needed to invest at today we'd have to sustain that for a few years before we would see the oil supply come. I think the natural gas supply will come quicker. You'll see a response on natural gas in the 6 months to 12 months' time frame not 2 to 3 years.Sure. We've got quite a bit of downstream silicone capacity coming on. A fair amount of it is in China. It's in a wide range of markets. It's in construction markets in electronics and mobility it's in personal care markets. Silicones is used in such a wide variety of applications. And those markets are all growing substantially. EVs use 2 to 3x more silicones than a traditional internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs' growth rates right now are relative. Year-over-year growth rates are super strong. So I think both return of internal combustion vehicle sales as the semiconductor chip issue is alleviated and the EV growth is going to really drive a lot of demand there. Autonomous vehicles 5G capabilities all require more silicones. We have to eliminate the crosstalk in all those areas. And you've got to put up a lot more infrastructure in cities for 5G to support absolute continuous coverage in those areas. And that's really really strong. There are about 20 debottlenecking projects that are in those total projects. They're anything from new vulcanized products lower viscosity fluids for personal care applications all kinds of gels for EVs electronics mobile optics for automotive lighting. So think about the headlamps in a vehicle not being polycarbonate anymore but being moldable optical silicone. Those are some of the biggest growth areas in that sector.Yes. If we were to get $0.09 as you suggested we'd probably be close to that peak in the Americas maybe a little bit shy of that peak in Europe and a fair bit off of the peak in Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific has been under a lot of pressure because of the much higher cost. Their cash margins in Asia have been really really slow. And you've seen a lot of turndown in rates in Asia. But I would say yes on North America you'd be back close to that peak maybe a few cents below it and same with Europe. So I think you're looking at it the right way. If we were to get $0.09 -- the other way to look at it is if we were to get the whole $0.09 we would probably cover the turnaround costs in P&SP and that wouldn't be a drag on the quarter. That's not what we've got in the forecast but it is possible that that could happen.Demand has been relatively stable. I would say we don't have as much of a footprint in plastics in China as we do in Performance Materials & Coatings and we do in silicones and we do in Industrial Solutions. And so for plastics a lot of what we would move in would be from the U.S. Gulf Coast or obviously from our partners in the Middle East. Having said that our demand was still pretty strong year-over-year going into China. We're seeing a lot of accelerated turnaround activity right now in China. So you're seeing crackers not just in China but in Southeast Asia and North Asia lowering operating rates you're seeing them take turnaround time now instead of just slowing rates and continuing to operate. We've seen a lot of pressure on coal to olefins and methanol to olefins. And so I think that will continue. And obviously I do believe that China is seeing some advantage of being able to buy feedstocks probably from Russian sources at discounted rates. So that may be helping a little bit but it certainly isn't making them positive cash margins. And I think we're going to be in that kind of environment for the next couple of quarters.Yes. Good question Steve. I would say in general on hedging and both in the United States as well as in Europe we've increased our hedging positions on natural gas just based on what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. And we moved those positions over time whether it be oil or natural gas. And we've had higher positions on both over the last couple of years. Our biggest move is just based on our usage and our usage of natural gas and other feedstocks is so ratable that that physical demand that we create is where we play most with the hedging. So what we can do with physical positions what we can do with feedstock flexibility around cracking probably is our biggest bang for the buck bottom line. And then the paper strip and the physical are the financial hedge is next after that. When it comes to e-cracking the biggest challenge on e-cracking right now is finding the right materials of construction to make an electric coil for a cracker furnace that can withstand the heat that you need to be able to crack hydrocarbons and have any kind of life. And so I would say before we start thinking about what the return on that will be we've got to just see if we can get the materials of construction right and be able to have a furnace coil that will have any kind of life to it at all and that can operate at a high operating rate and have good reliability over a long period of time. And that's the biggest proof point on this pilot project. And then we can work ourselves into do we have the renewable energy at the right cost to be able to make that happen. We're doing that work in the Netherlands. I think it's important to note that the Netherlands has 6 new nuclear plants on their long-term plan. And I think that's a great sign in terms of what they see in terms of the need to basically decouple. They're going to have to rely a lot more on nuclear power to have high reliability low-cost power. And that's going to be especially important for our industry as we move forward. And we need to look at that same thing. We're looking at that here in the U.S. in terms of small modular nuclear reactors.Yes that's a good question. About 25% of our product mix is in the functional polymers when you look at P&SP downstream. Typically the way you would think about functional polymers is they would typically hold their price through the cycle. They typically have less price dynamic movement compared to the commodity side of the business. But they're up quite a bit this quarter and I would say that's because demand has been strong on the downstream for them and there hasn't been a lot of new capacity added there. So just a tighter supply/demand balance on some of those functional polymers than we've seen. And I think some of that will continue because some of the markets that they go into are infrastructure-related. They can go into wiring cable markets they can go into things like geomembranes and roofing for commercial buildings. And so as you see more infrastructure-related projects I think you're going to see that strong demand last longer here for functional polymers and that will probably keep the prices of those materials up. Also some higher input costs for some of the monomers to make functional polymers is going to have to pass through as well.Yes. Look good question Arun. On MDI the balances through 2026 are pretty good. Demand looks like it's going to continue to outpace supply through 2026. So I think that continues to be positive for MDI. On polyethylene as I mentioned in the Gulf Coast -- in the U.S. Gulf Coast we've seen inventories come down. Inventories were down in March by about 200 million pounds and days of demand decreased by about 9%. So it's about 46 days of demand and that's pretty -- if I looked at all of last year they probably ran around 45 days all of last year. So I'd say pretty normal. And that is with still some congestion in the ports for the export channel. So I would say supply challenges will still put upward pressure about 3 to 4 days on DDI. And half of that's due to third-party congestion and the other half is inventories that were built to cover turnaround season in second quarter which is typically the heaviest turnaround season. Based on the way things are moving every month we're seeing a little bit better export flows out of the Gulf Coast. So I think if we can keep steady improvement through the year hopefully we can get back to a more normal kind of predictable rate by the end of this year.Well that's a good question. I think it's unlikely that we get into it just to monetize it. Our contribution -- and remember our equity interest here is relatively low. We stepped in and made a contribution of land and access to our infrastructure services for the site in Stade. And those of you who are not familiar Stade is about 40 minutes upstream from Hamburg on the Elbe River. And we've got the capability. We've got our own port there and we've got the capability to have a birth for an LNG ship to land in there. And so by contributing that land we take an equity position in that Hanseatic Energy Hub. They've got plans to build the new terminal by 2026. They're going through the approvals right now. If they can get that done that will satisfy 15% of Germany's natural gas demand. And so that will really help Germany have a second source of supply to the Russians. And that's very strategic and I think that's important for the country. So that's the reason we got into it to make it happen. We're not far enough along yet to get into what the offtake agreements are but we will provide utilities. We'll provide cooling and other things to be able to help them make that a zero carbon emissions hub. And I'm glad we were in a position to be able to do it. There's been some talk about building an LNG import facility in Germany for some time but we were at the point where we were not sure whether Stade would still be on the table. And this came together relatively quickly after the Russia-Ukraine situation. And I'm really happy that the team was able to move in fast and put a stake in the ground on this.,0.003917654,0.006856441,0.001404209
200,200,PAYX,Mucci:,"Yes. I would say new business formations are down a little bit from last year now but they're up from '20. They're still up very strong from pre-pandemic levels up 20% to 30% over pre-pandemic levels. Now there was a big jump last first quarter and frankly the first half of -- like our fiscal year as we think about it in new business formation. They were up 40% 50%. Now they're up really 20% to 30% over the previous pandemic years. And we do very well with brand-new businesses. We certainly do well. As I mentioned it picked up some real positive performance in the mid-market but we're also doing very well with brand-new clients that are starting up. Obviously we still have great relationships with CPAs and as well as banks in getting referrals. We're also able to do a lot of these sales digitally as we've really improved the ability for our clients to go online look at our product demo the product even on their mobile phone or online as well as then go right through to actually starting to set up and onboard themselves all digitally without talking to anyone. We certainly have a lot of pride in our field sales force and our digital sales -- our voice or telephonic sales force but the digital sales is becoming a bigger part of brand-new businesses obviously and we're very proud of that.No I would say both are actually growing quite well. HR outsourcing in total is growing well and I think we've positioned ourselves very well on the PEO side as well as ASO. I would say the PEO side has picked back up more recently. I think we talked about it last year maybe the last couple of quarters that insurance wasn't as in demand at that time because of getting through the pandemic. That is starting to come back now more because of a sense of retention of your employees and hiring your employees. It's -- as you know it's a very competitive market out there. And so now the insurance plans your health insurance et cetera your dental your voluntary insurances they're becoming very much a competitive offering to attract employees in a tough market and retain those that you have. So the interest in insurance has picked back up. So both our ASO and PEO frankly are double-digit growers and have done very well in the first quarter.No sure. We're actually already involved in it. It's basically -- what you're doing is also automating and digitizing a lot of the underwriting process and the information that you have to get onboarding of clients including in the PEO we're looking more and more to go to employees to help them self-onboard and makes it easier on the client and the prospect itself as they're onboarding. And so it was sending a link to employees to say """"Hey give me your information load your own information in and get started."""" That will transform I think over to the PEO side and certainly automation in the underwriting side which makes -- will make the whole process faster. So oh yes the digital -- there's going to be no limit to the selling from a digital standpoint. People are going to want to continue to find ways to have everything automated for them to be able to glean online set themselves up look at the product and buy you may still have some -- certainly sales rep involvement on the complication of insurance plans and so forth but we're always looking to make that easier and anything that a client can do for themselves or allow their employees to do for themselves is exactly where we're going strategically and we've already made a number of steps that way.Yes Kartik it definitely has. Accounts and banks are still important to us accountants in particular great relationship with them for many many years and the assistance that we give them and support we give them for their clients as well. But that has definitely come down as a percentage and digital has gone up as a percentage. I would say it's been a pretty steady change and I expect it will probably even accelerate. So much more of our lead generation comes now from the marketing investments that we make and marketing has become a very important part of the sales function and how sales gets their leads and then frankly how clients view us and then come in online and just decide to buy. As I mentioned many clients now certainly under 10 employees at least can come into our website because they've seen us advertise somewhere or online through SEM and SEO and know that we're an expert in this field come in demo the product compare the product and even buy the product and start to set themselves up. So yes it's becoming a bigger -- certainly a bigger part of it. And of course that leads to efficiencies that Efrain has been talking about.From a macro standpoint I would say it's not showing up yet. I think it's -- what it's demonstrated to us -- and I started to see this through some of the data analytics work that our teams are doing here from our small business index is that it wasn't -- it's not just the unemployment because you could see some of the states had cut the extra unemployment benefit out and it really was not making a big difference in the who was going back to work. So I think what you're finding is it's going to take a little bit longer in the market. It's definitely still a tough hiring market. And I think that the cash balances everyone -- you can see this data cash balances are high checking accounts are high because people haven't either spent or they also have gotten other stimulus money whether it's child care or child tax -- or I'm sorry child benefits that they're getting right now. People are in a pretty good stage and I think they're still trying to test it out. Plus I think there's just still healthcare worries about their businesses that they're going back to. Do they have to wear masks? Is there a mandate or not? And I think it's going to take a couple more months to shake out. It's certainly the hiring has gotten better. Our hiring growth is -- the hiring growth in our small business index has gotten much stronger in the last couple of months especially in leisure and hospitality sectors and in other services sectors. But it's -- there's still a challenge out there in the hiring. So we expect it to pick up but it's going to be a little bit longer than just -- it's not just the unemployment benefits that made the difference.Yes. I think it's more on the service side and frontline service. There's some in sales but it's kind of spread and it's not an overall large number in any sales division. So we feel good about that. We also -- and it's probably the hardest on the frontline service providers. John Gibson who runs all of services had done a great job with our HR team to find very creative ways though the hiring has really picked back up. We've shifted to some different ways to encourage new employees to come in different work schedules different abilities certainly work from home and a number of other benefits that they can get in the tools and support that they have. So it's picking back up now particularly just in the last 30 days but as Efrain said it's a tough market out there to hire particularly frontline service people. But as we said we still are seeing very strong client retention. We're getting the job done and we're certainly driving more calls to the website which our chat bot our automated response to service questions and other questions are being answered 60% of the time by the automated response. You can always reach someone live at Paychex 24 hours by 7 days a week 365 days a year. And -- but we are certainly looking for efficiencies and we're hiring very creatively and it's starting to pick back up again.Bryan which ones? Like the employment growth type of things?Yes. I mean I think we -- it may happen. We were -- we've been very happy with the retention obviously hitting record levels last year. And I do think what we're continuing to find from clients is we have really gained a lot as I said earlier from the COVID work that we did the ability to help them turn in their paperwork for their loans in the last 18 months. Then we have 90% of our clients have been able to have their loans forgiven. A lot of that is we made it easy for them. We hear this time and time again that they were at a very dire point of going out of business yet we helped them get the loans. We've partnered with 3 fintech companies to provide them another source for loans. We helped them with the forgiveness. And now we're coming back to them saying """"Hey you can have an employee retention tax credit and you can get the cash right away. It's not like waiting and here's how you do it and we can do it all for you in a very automated fashion. And you can have on average $150 000 worth of cash in your pocket that you don't have to repay to the government."""" It's a huge stimulus to them. So it really has helped our retention. It gave us an opportunity to kind of show the full power of Paychex. And then on top of that as Efrain said I think more and more of those clients then saw the HR support as well not just on the payroll side but also in the HR support. And now they still need us to really help them through vaccine mandates what do I do with work from home policies how do I bring people back to work how do I handle hybrid how do I coach employees. All of the technology that we're showing them has really come to use for them even some of the things that are so out there from a digital standpoint that their employees can do from their mobile phone. It really has given us a chance to show them """"Hey here's all the things you can do to retain hire and grow your business and give you some cash in your pocket and that has really helped retention a great deal.Sure. There's -- one we've had a lot of success in as we said in double-digit growth in both ASO and PEO. And we've been able to go into the client base and get them to an HR outsourcing product first. But as I mentioned and as you just noted the insurance is coming back. We had a good quarter on insurance and you're seeing that in the PEO side in that it really is an environment where the #1 issue -- #1 or #2 issue with clients is how do I hire and retain people and then how do I get more efficient. The hire and retain has become not just about comp meaning pay but it has become about benefits as well. And so it's been very important from that standpoint. So we are having some success certainly in continuing to upgrade our current clients and sell brand-new clients as well on both PEO and ASO solutions.I would say actually the best job growth has been in the South. So even while they picked up some more -- they obviously had more cases you're seeing the best job growth from a macro standpoint and from our -- some of our sales in Florida in Georgia in Texas where there is -- but that is also a function of great demand right that's going there. And there's more people there migrating there as everyone knows. And so you're seeing more businesses open up there. You're seeing more people available to fill jobs that's helping more demand that's increasing checks per payroll that kind of thing. So I would say no I'm sure that has had some impact. But overall states like Florida have actually been quite positive.Yes. I think Paychex Pre-Check will -- it's just a staggered approach as it's going out now but I think something like that will have big efficiency gains for clients which will help a lot on retention. We're not looking -- we're not charging additional cost for that revenue for that that's part of the service that a client opts in for. But when you hear that clients are trying to be more efficient it's things like that that are really going to help on the retention and I think the revenue per client so what -- the kind of price and the ability we get from that. So we're very excited about that one. Also that it is tied to the technology. It's tied to smart speakers. We're the only company tied to all 3 major voice assistant platforms. This is just a whole new way for clients to be able to handle things with their employees to say """"Hey your paycheck is ready. Would you like to check it your paystub?"""" Or from an employer standpoint that you get Alexa that's telling you """"Hey you have 3 things to do today as an employer"""" I mean these kind of things are really tying much better retention than anything. And the retention insights for example really just uses the artificial intelligence to a great deal. You can check not only pay but you can look at -- we look at like 15 20 different indicators that are in the payroll in the system in the software that will say """"Here's your performance rating of this person. Here's -- their pay is below the national average based on [POS] and their pay is below the rest of the team that have this job category of your own company. Hey watch out on the dashboard this person may be likely to leave you."""" When clients start seeing that it's not as much about the revenue directly from that software it's from the retention of saying """"I can't live without this just like the mobile app has been like that for us. They have a five-star mobile app that employees don't want to leave because it's easy to use and they can do so many things themselves it's great from a retention standpoint. So we're really excited about the level of speed that we're putting out software enhancements and the strength of being much more of a technology company and software company and that that's leading to retention.Yes. It could. It certainly is going to help keep it up there. I think as Efrain mentioned earlier and Mark you know so well there's always -- there is a natural level of just turnover of businesses on the smaller to midsize. So it's not going to get up there. But we're very proud of hitting a record level of retention last year and we expected that to come down some this year. But as Efrain said we have a Mendoza line that we're kind of saying """"Hey this is where we ought to be able to hold it.""""Yes we're seeing it kind of across the board. So I think we're doing very well competitively. And we've also still in-house as well doing well against what is. The major competitor and some of the other that you know so well I think we're doing very well against them with the technology enhancements the software enhancements that we've just mentioned and the ability to be able to show all of that. I think sometimes people still think of us as a more of a service company great service company but not the technology. When we're able to show the technology enhancements that we've introduced in the last few years we come up against other competitors and we perform extremely well. And as Efrain mentioned you know we're fully integrated so we can provide everything on one solution Flex right from retirement to insurance to HR and payroll. So it's not necessarily where you might go to a competitor that says """"Hey I'm going to pass you to somebody else to do the retirement or pass you to somebody else to do this. Not to mention over 650 HR specialists who are really have been there in the last couple of years nobody else has a team like that in my opinion. So...Absolutely. I mean I think many of the things that we've talked about have really helped clients. You can go right from a financial perspective which is the employee retention tax credits giving them dollars in their pocket to pay more for existing employees or to attract employees. So we go right at them to help them with their own financial situation. Then when you look at from the product standpoint you have all of these things benefit plans retirement plans HR guidance and support. Many companies 25 30 employees still don't really have the great HR support knowledge that they need to be able to how do I re-attract. And one that I haven't even mentioned today which is really important is we've had this partnership with Indeed. We have a very fully integrated partnership with Indeed which is the largest -- the world's largest job posting system. And we actually -- a client can go out and post on Indeed they actually get a credit because they're with Paychex with Indeed for the first couple of postings. They can go out on that job board post that -- if someone applies for that job they give their demographic information obviously in the application. If that's accepted that comes over with no need to then put that into our system again. It transfers over through API. So we also think we've helped them by getting them in front of the biggest job posting system and making it easy for them to post the job through Flex place it on Indeed somebody applies it comes back from Indeed self-populates really if their person is hired into the payroll system and the HR system and everything is set. So we've made it easy as much as we can for clients to hire and then retain by giving them the benefits and so forth to keep that employee. So we're very proud of the Indeed partnership and what that does not only gives them a little financial incentive and some discounts on their postings but it really makes it easy for them to post. And these are companies even 5 employees to 50 that still struggle sometimes with where to post for a job.Ashley if there's no more -- Efrain does have a statement that he wants to make before we close out.Great. At this point we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call will be archived for approximately 90 days. Thank you for your participate in our first quarter press conference -- press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great rest of the week.",0.226400044,0.989156365,0.405224743
201,201,CNC,London:,And I've pointed this out before but I'll do so again because I think it's an important bellwether that the work that the Marketplace team did to really understand the competitive dynamics on a county-by-county level and then to build that up to the portfolio performance that we were aiming for I think is not only tremendously impressive work but is also a good indicator of how we think about going into the calibration of margin and growth in Medicare in the upcoming bid cycle.Yes. And then on the Magellan front I would say the team out there worked very very closely with the state in those early days live and has been performing very very well since mid- to late February. There are 0 backlog in authorizations and I think has built a really positive relationship with through that collaboration. Relative to the RFP California is a very important state for us and we have -- throughout the Magellan acquisition process throughout the Rx go-live and throughout our bid process have been very focused on making sure that we are aligned with the state and meeting their expectations and looking to exceed their expectations. So there were challenges out of the gate but I think the team recovered incredibly well. you'd have to ask California but at least the signals we're getting from them is that they're very happy with the collaboration and the partnership.Sure. Thanks for the question. So I'll hit on the PBM front and invite Drew to weigh in as well because we've been having these conversations with potential partners together. We're -- we issued the RFP early. We're still on track for the year-end award but part of the logic of getting the RFP out there earlier was to allow for the more strategic conversation about what the scope would be with that partner. The key criteria are obviously going to be quality and performance. Transparency is incredibly important and then also feeling that like we have a very close partner. And so economics are incredibly important probably first second and third but then also making sure that as we deliver a member and provider experience that we have a very responsive partner that is as focused on quality as we are. I don't know Drew if you want to add anything.And then on the strategy front obviously we'll get more into this in June and I think more over the back half of the year. But you've heard us lay out some of the principles. And so making sure that we are growing from the strength of the core business lines and looking at obvious adjacencies and then making sure that we are operating at a high level of excellence on an ongoing basis because we believe that will build the trusted relationships and through that local approach can give us a differentiated strategy for growth. So more to come in June on that.Sure. Thanks A.J. I will just clarify relative to Medicare the focus is absolutely on margins still preserving slight growth but really starting to turn the dial on margin expansion. And it's -- as Drew has said before it's a multiyear journey but it starts in 2023. Drew do you want to talk about utilization?So the best person to answer that question and the answer to your second question is Brent.And I would just reiterate relative to the timing that again we released RFP early in order to give time for those fulsome conversations but we're still on track for year-end award. And as Drew has said and we have said multiple times that there's nothing like a good old-fashioned RFP to make sure that we're getting the best economics.And I would just touch back on Brent's comments as well that the benefit of being so conversant with our states and helping them to even think about what the right strategy is going into redeterminations and what the impacts might be is that we have line of sight to how each one of the states is thinking and some of that thinking is shifting. So we have states that started off thinking that they could through the roles in 3 months and I think then better digested the fact that it was probably if coverage continuity and voter abrasion was important that that's more like a 12-month plan but we're seeing states everywhere from 5 months which I think is probably the most aggressive all the way to 17 months. And again just the fact that we're in those conversations gives us line of sight to plan and then as Drew said also be able to bring forward data that make sure that the rates are actuarially sound based on the impact we think we'll incur.Thanks Rocco and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations with any follow-up calls and we'll talk to you soon.,0.003035863,0.003434956,0.000294486
202,202,SPG,Simon:,Well I mean I donâ€™t know. I mean I know I wouldnâ€™t be selling our stuff at a 7% cap rate. Thatâ€™s all. I can only speak for myself.Thank you.Okay. The first question is not really on the retail side. Weâ€™re anticipating more or less if they come in on plan. And then I didnâ€™t follow. Brian did you understand the second part of the question?Yes MichaelYes. Thatâ€™s â€“ okay. Thatâ€™s what I thought but I want to make sure. So Reebok closed. SPARC bought the U.S. operations of Reebok at the end of February if I remember correctly. And we think that will come out most of â€“ itâ€™s kind of â€“ it probably will come out in the Q2 Q3. But itâ€™s not really â€“ itâ€™s kind of a work in progress or when those operating losses will take hold. They incur certain operating losses I should say they we. SPARC concurs. Certain operating losses is part of the deal and then theyâ€™re capped and it really is just a function of when those come. Itâ€™s â€“ but we know itâ€™s limited to kind of the number that I gave to you â€“ but thatâ€™s probably a Q2 Q3 event.Yes. So our â€“ the number right now is 12.3%. What was it? What was â€“ no no before COVID. No it was higher than that. That was higher than that. Anyway weâ€™ll give you the number where it was pre-COVID but I thought it was in the kind of the high 13% 14% range. But weâ€™ll get you â€“ what was it?13 and change. And look I canâ€™t tell you how long itâ€™s going to take a function of it is just marking leases to market. But itâ€™s fortunate for us and our retailers that theyâ€™re profitable in our stores. And yet at the same time we can mark the rents up to market and be able to grow our business too. So thatâ€™s what weâ€™re trying to achieve.I think Tom can give you the exact numbers later but I mean both trends are in the moving in the right direction. So Tom to get you the actual numbers but both are moving in the right direction. And I think that the gap between the two in a good market like we have now will narrow.Sure. I think â€“ oh sorry go ahead sir.Okay. Thank you and Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll see some of you in the next few weeks. Thank you.,0.003201365,0.003665924,0.000464559
203,203,OTIS,Marks:,Hi.Yes itâ€™s not a demand issue Julian itâ€™s just a delay in the delivery and the recognition of revenue.Julian the only other thing I would add is what we saw in repair in the first quarter was very positive which shows even in the regions where people are concerned about office populations we are seeing elevator usage pick up in the â€“ really in the commercial side of the business as well. And our repair business certainly indicated that in Q1. Thatâ€™s going to help drive this â€“ again this margin expansion in service as we go through Q2 through Q4.Yes. Joe good morning they are. I mean we had secured some large projects in â€˜21 and that will actually not just be second half of this year will be more strong in early â€˜23. And thatâ€™s still consistent. Those projects are all on schedule. So what we said last quarter still holds.Well it all takes activity. So even though we have those clauses in the contract they donâ€™t automatically happen at a renewal unless we can enforce it and sell the value of what we are doing. So our sales force had to go out and basically make all of that happen. So there was nothing that would just happen automatically mechanically or commercially. So it was all make happen and the team did a great job explaining how we had additional costs and how itâ€™s appropriate for those to flow through on price.Yes. Thanks Joe.Well Cai I think itâ€™s important to reinforce that we are following all sanctions that have been imposed by the U.S. the UK and â€“ so we are following all of those rules. We provide an important life safety service everywhere in the world especially in our service business. So we are â€“ obviously we are evaluating who should be or could be the rightful owner of this asset and thatâ€™s the evaluation we are under. We will share more as we learn more but we will have to see where that evolves.Yes. And Cai we were 1% 2 years ago. Actually in 2020 we were 2% portfolio growth. 1% in â€˜19 2% in â€˜20 3% last year. We said we would be 3%-plus. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s driving again everything we have said that to drive that portfolio is the key to our service success and we just had our fifth consecutive quarter of service organic sales growth and our ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating profit growth in our Service segment So this and growth in every region this quarter on the portfolio. So thatâ€™s what we need to continue to see going forward. Thatâ€™s what our team is focused on.Thanks John.Sure. So we talk about the smaller bolt-ons at about the $50 million-ish kind of level a year. As you can see when something is attractive like Zardoya Otis we didnâ€™t hesitate. And kudos to our team for just executing that with excellence with the squeeze out occurring. So we will be the full owner and delist in the next week or two weeks. So we are always looking for an opportunity. We think we are at a really good leverage point right now. We are still investment grade. We were able to keep that as well as repaying. We repaid $0.5 billion of debt in the first quarter after $350 million in â€˜20 and $450 million in debt in â€˜21. So we are keeping the debt kind of where we want it. Our gross debt is at about $6.75 billion right now and we think thatâ€™s a good place. And if a large strategic opportunity comes up whether itâ€™s in Europe or Asia or in the Americas we are going to â€“ we are obviously interested and we are going to evaluate it because the large generation type opportunities donâ€™t happen that often in this industry. So we are making sure we have got the flexibility on the balance sheet to do that. In the interim the cash we generate in-year we plan on returning to our shareholders. We raised our dividend late last week a little over 20%. And now thatâ€™s 45% over 2 years and already bought back $200 million of shares in the first quarter. As Rahul said we are going to do another $300 million. So we will be at $500 million for this year. And our Board reauthorized $1 billion cap for us to do that. So we are going to share with our shareholders until â€“ and keep our ability to do strategic acquisitions when they arise.Thank you.Hi Joel.Thank you Latonia. So to summarize we had a strong first quarter and continue to make progress on our strategic priorities while weathering macroeconomic challenges. We recognize the work left to be done to continue building on our track record of resiliency and strong execution. We are confident we will do just that and deliver 10% adjusted EPS growth in 2022 with continued momentum in 2023 and beyond. Thank you for joining our call and please stay safe and well.,0.003994127,0.006908774,0.002061117
204,204,MET,Gallagher:,Good morning. First question is just can you provide a little bit of color behind the around $400 billion of investment losses. I presume most of that was Russia-Ukraine but can you just give some specificity for the accounting for the $400 million?Got it. That makes sense Steve. So I would assume some of that there could be a little bit of a tail to the trading aspect of that as you roll into 2Q and rates have continued to go up. Is that fair.Okay. Got you. And then just I guess for Kishore just a follow-up on Japan the sales there seemed pretty good and your competitors that are in Japan were quite weak with the state of emergency orders in Japan. Just curious how you were able to drive sales growth is there something unique about product launches or your distribution that that allowed you to still grow sales across -- it looks like across all products in Japan.That was. Thank you.No. Thatâ€™s all. Thank you.,0.002325356,0.002325356,0
205,205,VRSK,Shavel:,And Ashish thanks for that mark. And Ashish I want to also come back and address your question on the longer term growth trajectory. And certainly within our existing businesses we see a constructive environment and good demand. But one area that I'll be focused on and this comes out I think some of my past experience as well as conversations with customers is that the insurance industry as a whole continues to look for opportunities to improve their efficiency to take substantial costs out of their operations to improve the digital experience with their customers. And I think our ability from where we sit to act as their technology partner in more of a utility role where we can find solutions for the industry is a tremendous opportunity for us to think more broadly about what we can do because if we are creating value for the industry we're creating value for our clients. And I think that will naturally drive value for our shareholders.Yes. Thank you Andrew. So let me first confirm that that 300 to 500 basis points half of the 50% to 51% assumes that we have separated energy. And so what we are trying to do is provide and reference as we did in the original statement what the consolidated insurance focused business looks like from a margin standpoint. So it explicitly assumes that we have separated energy within that context. And with regard to tax rate I think we are still sorting through that as we look at the complexity of the legal entities that we utilize on a global basis. And we have tried to utilize some of the legal efficiencies within those tax jurisdictions. I don't think at this point we're anticipating a dramatic change in the tax but I just want to maintain the fact that we are as part of our exercise trying to get a more precise read on what the tax implications are.Yes. Thank you Greg. I appreciate the question. I know this has been a focus for investors. And so the way I would describe it and on page 16 it's important to understand for 2021 that does include VFS 3E and Wood MacKenzie. And I would note that if we were looking at this on a segment basis the various financial services and Wood MacKenzie particularly as a function of the Lens investment that we have made as well as product enhancements that we were making at Verisk Financial Services we're operating at a higher CapEx as a percentage of revenue relative to our average. And so if we are looking at an insurance on focused entity while there will continue to be investment opportunities probably most notably with what we're describing as our four lines reimagine that we believe will deliver similar types of benefits to the Lens platform that we did with Wood MacKenzie that those areas of investment will continue to be important. But overall across the insurance that would have been and we expect would be below the average rate that we have been operating at over the past three to five years.Yes. Thanks Jeff. Look I appreciate the perspective and I think that we would agree there are a lot of growth opportunities within the business as we are sorting out the separation of the two businesses. Part of that exercise is looking at the overall insurance business and evaluating where there are growth where there are opportunities to invest where there are opportunities to deinvest. At this point given that I think it's early stage in making that assessment. And we're not prepared to change the guidance that we have. I think we've demonstrated on the subscription revenue that we have been able to achieve within insurance that 7% growth there are transactional revenues that we still are expecting to show recovery. But as we proceed through the separation my objective would be to give a more thoughtful and fulsome description of how we think about growth going forward as we are thinking about this as an insurance focus entity. I take the point there are a lot of growth opportunities we're going to be making investments. But at this stage we haven't reached the point where we're ready to make a change in that long-term guidance. We believe 7% organic constant currency or higher growth for the insurance business is a very solid respectable target with operating leverage that should drive EBITDA ahead of that. We've made our point in terms of our EBITDA expect expectations. And hopefully we'll continue to refine that as we think about where we want to focus where we want to invest and what we think the growth opportunities are.Thank you Heather. So I appreciate the question on the low end versus the high-end. I think there are two primary dimensions that will influence that. One is simply the quantum of opportunity that we identify and we want to identify as much opportunity as we can that doesn't impact the overall growth level of the business. And so that's we are certainly pushing to achieve as much of that margin improvement as we have laid out as possible. The other side of that is what is the level of investment that we think is necessary to support expand the overall growth and achieve good returns on that. That is the tension point as I've described before to many of you to many of the investors margin is a dynamic element that you have to understand in terms of what is -- what margin expansion is being generated on a pre-investment basis. And then what do you consume in order to support and expand growth and returns on beyond that. And so particularly as we are going through an environment with higher inflationary costs with high competition for our talent. We are evaluating those impacts which I would describe as environmental that we have to take into account that may influence where we end up in terms of that range. But the primary business tension will be the quantum of cost savings that are not growth impacting as well as our deliberate decision on what we're going to -- where we are going to invest and what the OpEx impact of that will be on our overall margins. But the primary objective is as I mentioned in my comments that growth and returns are the fundamental foundation for value creation for shareholders.Manav thank you for the question. And since as you observed those have been predominantly not exclusively in the insurance sector. I'm going to ask Mark to talk about the nature of those tuck-in acquisitions what we expect to achieve from a business standpoint. And then Stacey will either now or in our follow up calls provide context around the acquisition impact. Mark can I turn it over to you to talk through some of the recent insurance acquisitions?Thank you Mark. And one thing I want to add before Stacey will address the contribution elements Manav is adding one thing that we have been pleased with is the shift that we have made from more of a portfolio orientation from an acquisition standpoint to a focus on business unit driven acquisitions is that we have been able to identify where we can have an impact on the business we have focused on an improved and more intensive integration process. And so with acquisitions like FAST Jornaya and Sequel for instance we have been able to demonstrate improved performance against our expectations and really help accelerate a lot of good technologies that the insurance industry values but we can really help accelerate their adoption by the industry.Yes. So Jeff thanks for that. Couple of things. One I think that what's important to understand on that decline is that the primary contributor to that is the reallocation of expenses to the insurance and the energy sector. And so and if we achieve that separation with energy that will be a further allocation. That's what gets you to that 50% to 51% level. Now there are going to be effects within that quarter that influence if for instance we have the discrete professional costs. And we mentioned in that quarter there was a benefit from some compensation elements that will reverse. But I think that primary impact of the reallocation of the expenses is a good starting point for understanding kind of what our normal run rate expenses will be over the course of the year.Yes. Thank you George. I appreciate the question. And I'll start by saying first from a process standpoint obviously we are in -- the business is operating on a real-time basis we are making investments. And so on those we are maintaining what we believe was the right investment approach going into 2022. And so within our budget and so those are the types of investments that you want to maintain. We will look as we go into 2023 where the trade-offs are from a growth standpoint relative to the expense savings. And this is actually kind of the typical year-end discussion that Scott and Mark and I would have to evaluate what is the level of investment that we believe is advisable in the business to sustain to expand the growth opportunity? What is the margin impact? What are the returns on for all of those and we look at those options across all of the businesses and then determine what we think is the best and the most supportive. And so as -- we are near-term focused on achieving the cost savings identifying implementing those over the course of 2022. And then as we proceed and think about where we want to focus our investment on an ongoing basis within that business. We will look at those trade-offs. There is not a monolithic across the business perspective on this is what we are going to invest in growth because almost by necessity it needs to be a project-by-project and business-by-business determination and that we evaluate through our budget and our long range planning. So that's probably the best answer that I can give you. But we are always trying to one prioritize growth in returns while achieving the margin expansion objectives that we've outlined.Sure. Thank you Andrew. So the first point that I want to make is that as we detailed in our last call from an economic standpoint we are achieving a benefit from our transition to cloud meaning that our investments in that cloud migration have generated OpEx savings and CapEx savings across the portfolio that we have made. And it's important to understand that you have to look at both dimensions of that to see the economic value. But it does entail naturally an effective transition of what were formerly CapEx expenses into OpEx expenses in terms of our cloud-based expenses. And so firstly that investment is generating an economic value and is generating a high double-digit plus return on the capital that we invested within that. And I say that on the basis of having looked at the projects of where we've made those investments and then what we've achieved from an OpEx and CapEx savings standpoint. So we do believe that it is contributing both economic value and returns. Your broader question as I understand it is to understand the benefits from a business standpoint. And we do believe that the migration of those data sets into the cloud of the applications into the cloud facilitate more coordination and integration of the analytics that are able to draw from that consolidated data set. And in a way the Lens experience that we've had is a demonstration of that. First and probably most immediately in terms of the ease with which our customers can access data utilize data integrate into their processes improve their efficiency because we are sourcing from multiple systems or from legacy systems. And much of what we want to accomplish in our core lines reimagined moves in that direction as well process efficiency first but we're also improving the environment where we can associate data sets more and more effectively. But that is I think a more of a second stage achievement we're focused first on the economic value that we can achieve the process improvements for our clients and then ultimately the improved analytical opportunity. There's certainly may be overlap. But generally that's the process. And to-date I would say on that data benefit that is still largely an unrealized in certain areas I think we've achieved it. But in terms of the broader opportunity I think there's still much more for us to do. And it ties into I think this broader infrastructure or utility opportunity that we see for the industry as a whole as that data becomes consolidated in a more consistent architecture. It facilitates broader industry process improvements.Yes. So Faiza thanks that's a lot of questions to throw at me. But we'll try to knock them down one by one. So at this point the dollar detail as we are developing this as we are anticipating what we can achieve over the course of 2022 we aren't at the stage where we are ready to provide $1 breakdown on the expense. With regard to your question on operating leverage operating leverage is really the key element that I focus on and I am -- we do embrace the fact that this opportunity to rethink our cost base fundamentally improves our operating leverage. We've always been focused on businesses that have solid operating leverage. And as we drive strong organic growth into the business that magnifies the EBITDA growth and that naturally produces margin expansion offset by our level of investment. The last question or element of the question related to the impact of M&A. And there our focus is on generating growth and returns. I think embedded in your question is do we rely on acquisitions to maintain our growth rate? I think the short answer is no we do look for businesses that we can create value from that are higher growth and represent opportunities for us to accelerate and to generate returns. But we believe that our internal opportunities to grow and as we've demonstrated in a variety of areas including with our Lightspeed products and within our claims business with a number of the products that we've added there within our Extreme Events Solutions businesses those have all been strongly performing growth businesses for us. Looking ahead we obviously can't anticipate the acquisitions that may become available to us. Our acquisitions are typically for smaller higher growth businesses that do have lower margins. And if we do see acquisitions that we think are value creating we will pursue those and they may have a negative margin impact. In fact they're probably likely to have a negative margin impact that would be outside of our overall objectives here but they're fundamentally focused on value creation through our ability to accelerate and drive both growth in returns. So our analysis is based on the business as it is right now that we can achieve that against that insurance focus consolidated business but we aren't making any assumptions in terms of what our future acquisitions are. Those have to be opportunistic and based upon our discipline.Yes. Hans let me ask Mark to provide a high-level view we obviously have hundreds of products with different pricing dimensions. So again it's not a monolithic business. But Mark perhaps you can offer some perspectives on how we think about value-based pricing model?Yes. Thank you Kevin. So the first comment is as we are kind of looking at this separation I would just kind of leave it at right now. The investment on the energy side relative to revenue would be above that average driven by that level of Lens investment in 2021 and 2022. And so we would expect that there would be an improvement on that. But we want to look at that separation before we evaluate changing that guidance which we still adhere to. The second part of your question is one yes we are seeing that CapEx savings as you can see on that slide but that internally developed software will continue to be an important component of the way that we invest to deliver value to our clients. It is creating platforms for the data it is creating software automation solutions for clients. And that will continue to be an important component for the way that we either improve efficiency or make better decisions within our business as a whole. Our business is becoming more software intensive. And we think that's a good thing because of the value that we can create for them. One from a process standpoint but also recognize that in a lot of the software businesses that we have and have acquired are essentially networks of participants in the insurance ecosystem. Our Sequel business or Specialty Business Solutions is probably the best example of that. And that creates opportunities for us to utilize that data to create analytics and to provide new functionality that supports the ecosystem. And so that's why it's so important in a way with that software we are able to recreate in other markets of the network effect that we have enjoyed historically within our domestic business. And I would also note when you look at our acquisitions Fast sequel Jornaya they are more software intensive and are associated with that higher growth rate. So that will be an ongoing an important component for us.So with that I think that is our final question. Thank you for your time today. Thanks again to Scott for all of his contributions and we look forward to the ongoing dialogue with all of you as we proceed. Have a good day.,0.002987236,0.0039258,0.000412624
206,206,SQ,Ahuja:,And the Afterpay piece as well here Ramsey it helps with us in terms of getting access to consumer still in markets outside the US through Afterpay that we can then leverage as we bring Cash App and the Cash App brand in those markets.Sure. Yeah. Let me jump in here and give you some stats on Cash App Taxes. As you know in January we launched our free digital tax filing service for customers. It really simplifies the experience which has historically been complicated expensive unwieldy for customers. It simplifies the experience and our customers can get their tax refund sooner if they're direct depositing in the Cash App. And at the end of tax season we had more than 1.5 million people filing their taxes with Cash App Taxes. We find that these filers to Cash App Taxes are more engaged with the Cash App ecosystem. They're twice as likely to use paycheck deposits in the first quarter compared to the average monthly actives. And they are driving inflows as you noted into the platform. 75% of those who used Cash App Taxes and have a Cash Card account selected Cash App as their refund method. We have always seen the tax season in the past has been driver of inflows for us in the Cash App. And we've seen that again in the first quarter. It's a piece of the inflows that come into Cash App more broadly. So I wouldn't say that that's necessarily different this quarter than in the past what we've historically seen. But what Cash App Taxes does is it helps bring awareness to our broader banking platform to the ability to direct deposit. And it's a utility for our customers that's seamless and provides value to them to the broader integrated suite of products that we have for them making deposits even easier.And I'll just add to that Josh. You've heard us talk about this in the past I think last quarter too that what we see for Afterpay in their more established markets like Australia and New Zealand what we see there is an increasing presence across omnichannel not just online but also in-person. And that omnichannel consumers who are using buy now pay later in-person as well as online transact at higher rates than online-only consumers because it becomes a part of how they manage their cash flow it becomes top of mind for them in terms of how they make purchases. And that is something that we think as Jack spoke to is unique about our platform in that there's a lot of complementarity between the Square platform and the Afterpay platform and how we can help Afterpay grow with our access to millions of sellers across the US and outside the US both online and in-person.Sure. So what I would say for April is that you're right that March and April of last year are tough comps for us because of the significant government fund disbursements that came about last year. That's part of why I would orient you more to those three-year CAGR metrics that I was sharing for April where we do see some more consistency between the periods that we're looking at here from Q1 into April and where you do get to normalize around some of those COVID comps that you're speaking to in the prior year time frame. So again I would orient you to the three-year metrics that we're seeing where Square GPV growth on a three-year basis in April came in at about 24%. Cash App gross profit ex Afterpay coming in at about 85%. And so still strong continued growth. And again the three-year CAGR help normalize for some of the year-over-year. The second part of your question on OpEx was really just some refinement for us based on the pacing of the expected investments for the remainder of the year. The reduction here is relatively minimal in the context of the broader non-GAAP OpEx expected investments for 2022 less than a 4% decrease as we refine these numbers. And for Block ex Afterpay it's really just about reflecting the pacing spend for some of the newer and experimental marketing channels.Sure. What I would say for Afterpay is that our focus in the near term is around growing our customer base managing our loss rates and driving increased consumer frequency as I mentioned earlier and we're happy with the progress we're making on each of those pieces. And you're right we have not yet fully integrated or seen the vision come to life yet across the connecting points between merchants and consumers whether Square and Cash App platform you hear a lot of -- you'll hear a lot more about that in a couple of weeks at Investor Day. We -- our teams are deep at work on that integrated commerce vision. And we have so much more to come on that which we're really excited about. We really think we have a differentiated offering to provide over the long-term here as we think about how our commerce platform will be different from others. And we think we can be truly differentiated on non-price factors when you think about the consumer scale that we have across Cash App and Afterpay. And then when you think about the merchant scale that we have across Square and Afterpay we believe that what we're building will be resilient and a sustainable strategy over the long-term for both sides of the ecosystem merchants and consumers. We hope to lay all that out for you at Investor Day on May 18.,0.004097998,0.004563272,0.000656059
207,207,A,McMullen:,Yeah. Thanks for that Patrick. We saw -- we see the Omicron impact is transitory. We saw that in the U.S. for example and we would expect to I think Bob you called out in the script back to normal kind of levels in February. So we actually expect the environment to improve over the year. I think we are flattish for Q1. But Bob I think we are calling for mid-singles or so growth for the full year. So that would imply a pickup in growth in this segment later on this year.You are very welcome.Good afternoon Jack.Absolutely.Hi Mike.Yeah. I am going to pass it over to Jacob for some more details here. But also I would also just remind we also had a very good print on the pathology side of our Diagnostics business. But I think you will hear from Jacob LC/MS is an indication of some future traction we are already getting some good growth. So Jacob your thoughts there?And Jacob on the Ultivo what I think the customers love the combination of performance and the size of the footprint really fits nicely into the diagnostic lab.Bob do you want to take it or do you want me to?Sure.Yeah. Sure. Happy to address that Mike. So I appreciate by the way the recognition of the variety of where we deploy capital. But thereâ€™s a consistent theme across where we deploy capital which is high growth end markets which will drive increase to the overall core growth of the company in places where we can leverage the scale and the capabilities we have in the company to really make those businesses even more successful. So I think thereâ€™s a timing kind of an underlying theme behind all those acquisitions. So that would continue to be our thesis and our approach as well as staying focused in the private sector which we think thereâ€™s -- really fits well the Agilent model and often the potential acquired companies and leadership teams really find the Agilent culture a good place to be and they also see how well we have done with previous acquisitions. So we have got a track record as well that they can point to. And I am on record saying that we wanted to deploy our balance sheet as part of our overall growth story. Itâ€™s part of what we have been calling our build and buy growth strategy. And as you may know the largest deal that we have done to date has been -- was the acquisition of BioTek but we believe we can do multiples of that deal and be willing to deploy capital if the right opportunity comes along for us.Sure.Great question. So I think this is actually a story both for the Pharma as well as elements of our Chemical and Energy business. And Iâ€™d say right now not yet material in terms of order book or revenue but we believe itâ€™s coming. Thereâ€™s a lot of discussions with customers that are building new capacity. I would say itâ€™s probably more of a 2023 kind of event. But I think it speaks to the durability of growth that we think we have in Agilentâ€™s two largest end markets. So we are hearing lots of discussions about dual sources of critical components onshoring of previously offshore critical supply chain elements. So I think the continued supply chain challenges that the world is seeing is only putting more emphasis on that direction. So Iâ€™d say right now itâ€™s in the longer term planning phase. As you know the analytical laboratory instrumentation is often the last thing thatâ€™s added when they bring on new capacity but we believe itâ€™s coming but itâ€™s not been material yet to the companyâ€™s performance.Yeah. So I am going to have Padraig jump in here with some additional specifics. As you know I have asked Padraig to take on this role in addition to his leading the overall Agilent Services business. But we are just delighted with the start of this new structure and I think I always say the proofs in the results and we are off to a good start with the fact that we had such a strong Q1 order book throughout the quarter. And Padraig I know itâ€™s been just a few months where you have been pulling your team together and but I think you are already starting to work with customers differently and maybe you could share some of your thoughts here.Sure Dan.Sure.Yeah. Iâ€™d say if you look at the three sub-segments of the C&E marketplace we often talk about the Chemicals Energy and Advanced Materials market. I think itâ€™s the Chemicals and Advanced Materials market segments that are driving the growth here. Now theoretically when -- although be it now much -- itâ€™s a very small part of the total number these days higher oil prices would tend to lead to more investment in that Energy segment portion of the whole market segment. But I canâ€™t remember the exact percentage. I know itâ€™s evolved a bit over time. But I think whatâ€™s most interest to us is how does the world view global growth were PMI. So yes I think the highest correlation of growth in this segment relate to PMI and the global growth outlook. But we would -- there could be some more money to invest in exploration perhaps if oil prices stay high but itâ€™s really also really driven by the PMI view. Thatâ€™s why they still remain positive and thatâ€™s why we are optimistic about our ability to grow this overall market throughout the rest of this year.Yeah.Yeah. I think theâ€¦â€¦ message here is the yeah the Pharma growth was strong for the biopharma NASD but also across the rest of the companyâ€™s portfolio as well.So itâ€™s an Agilent wide story.Yeah.All I can tell you about is whatâ€™s going on in my business which is its doing very well. So we have got -- we had -- we continue to see very strong business momentum. The market demand is very robust. You may have recall in my script I tried to call out demand in our chromatography systems remains very robust. We saw double-digit growth again in Q2 -- Q1 2022 off double-digit or the prior year backlog strong orders growing faster than revenue. So thereâ€™s a lot to like about whatâ€™s going on with the LC business.You are very welcome.Come on Paul. I know you are up to it. I know you are up to it.Bob why donâ€™t we tag team on this but Iâ€™d say itâ€™s really being driven by not only the NASD business we talked about earlier but our core LC/MS business. I mean there is some contribution from cell and gene therapy but it really is coming from the LC/MS business along with really strong growth of services and consumables as well. So Iâ€™d say itâ€™s really a broad-based story but really around our core instrumentation platforms along with services and consumables.I mean goes for that.Yeah. Sure. Happy to do. ACG has been what we are doing has been near and dear to our overall growth strategy for a number of years and we are very excited about the new relationship we have with Avantor. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s still very early days so not yet a material contributor to the topline revenue and that really was all according -- so itâ€™s proceeding according to plan. So Iâ€™d say thereâ€™s more to come in that regard. And then on the connect rate yeah in fact we called that out on purpose to say we continue to see higher connect rates with our consumables and services business and we think that bodes well for future growth. And Padraig maybe you want to just comment a bit on what you are seeing on the services side and the connect rate.Yeah. I think we had double-digit contract growth and probably more than 10% of Agilentâ€™s revenues now in -- under service contracts.,0.002666682,0.002999723,0.000225961
208,208,CHTR,Rutledge:,Yeah. We don't manage the margins. We managed to return on investment. And so we try to generate as much cash on each asset that we deploy as we can and has really nothing to do with margins when you have a mix of products with different kinds of margins in them. And so it's only in a static environment that a margin relative -- relative margin has any value as an analysis tool in our -- from our point of view.Exactly.Thanks Jessica. Peter weâ€™ll take our next question please.But another part of your question was what's the overall broadband penetration. And if you take all those smaller speeds slow speed products it's in the mid-80s. And as I said earlier I think that goes up towards the vacancy rate.Like I was speaking about marketing earlier that's a form of price. We have lots of opportunity to mix and match various tactics to create value for customers perceived value. But fundamental value is where we're really trying to drive our product which is having superior products at lower prices than our competitors by doing smart investments and good technologies that allow us to have a lower cost structure and have a lower cost per bit so to speak available to consumers both in the mobile space and in the broadband space and in the video space to the extent it's a separate business. And we can mix and match those value propositions in a variety of ways depending on what we need to do to move customer perceptions about where the true value is in the product set.Jessica you want answer the bad debt question?And with regard to video why we're somewhat of an outlier we try hard for one thing. And again we try to put value where we can for the consumer and think that there's still opportunity in video. And one of the things that we had success with is the creation of additional packaging and the mix of video products that we actually sell to consumers. And we're continuously improving the right structures around what we're able to sell. And it's been difficult because of the way historically video has been packaged in this very fat expensive bundle that's driven by sports rights costs. And as we've been able to get some of the content out of that the ecosystem and put into tiers and we're successfully selling those. And I think over time we'll be able to build a very nice video business.All right. Well in terms of sentiment yes there have been periods in my business career in cable where sentiment has gone up and down. And my sentiment remains the same. And I think it's a great business and I think we have great opportunity to take and to continue to grow the business successfully. And so when everybody's euphoric it's probably odd. And when everybody is pessimistic it's odd and I'm unchanged. And my experiences with Cablevision and other assets I managed Time Warner assets as well prior to that and have managed competition. My first job as a general manager in 1980 was an overbuild actually. And so I have lots of experience with it and lots of success in growing our businesses in that environment. So there's nothing unusual about what's going on now. And actually from a competitive environment it's pretty much unchanged the pace of what's been going on notwithstanding that there are some small builds going on elsewhere with private equity as you say and that LEC expansion has continued. But it hasn't gone up in pace. So -- and we do quite well regardless of whether we're in a physical competition with a wireline builder or whether we're in competition with satellites or whether we're in competition with a fixed wireless asset. We're pretty comfortable that we can continue to drive our value proposition and continue to grow our customer relationships. So my sentiment is unchanged. And are there opportunities for us to buy some infrastructure companies that would help us make our network better because they happen to be in the right place? There probably is.I was optimistic last year and I was optimistic the year before that and still am.Thanks Ben.And in terms of the pace of upgrades we're actually doing multiple upgrades in various parts of the country right now. And we're pacing ourselves in such a way that we're learning how to do it really effectively. The interesting thing about our capacity to do these upgrades is that they're quite simple electronic upgrades. They're relatively inexpensive and we can do them rapidly across as much of our footprint as we need to do. And we're just actually putting ourselves in a position right now so that we can execute at the pace we need to execute given where the demand for that kind of capacity will exist. And we haven't really forecasted that publicly in terms of how fast we're going to do that.,0.003087997,0.003744602,0.000468302
209,209,XEL,Van,Abel: And Ryan just to add on to that I absolutely agree with what Bob said in terms of longer term. In the short term certainly we expected some solar plus storage projects come online in Colorado and we're negotiating with the developers there about the impacts we're seeing. So we'll evaluate alternative opportunities to ensure we have reliability in the system.Abel: Yes Dave. And on Uri we are awaiting that ALJ decision we should get it at the end of May about the 25th. And we're still fairly far apart with the office of Attorney General and Department of Commerce. I mean if you read our testimony and our comments we strongly disagree with their assertions. And we believe we acted prudently in accordingly to the commission approved hedging procedures really for the best interest of our customers. So we'll await that ALJ recommendation. And then once you get the ALJ recommendation it should likely be in August with the commission decision on that. On the rate cases it is -- it's still early in the proceeding. There's a couple of other rate cases in front of us that they call it or have been serially working through. So we haven't a lot of discovery yet in the electric or gas case. So not a whole lot to update you on. But certainly as we get through the year like I said we talked about so the MISO capacity auction being helped mitigating the impacts we've seen really good sales growth in Minnesota and our economy is strong here in Minnesota. So it's a good thing to see that hopefully as we get later in the year and can start to talk about settlement opportunities with intervenors and we can reach a pretty constructive outcome for all of our parties.Abel: Thank you all for participating in earnings call this morning.

210,210,EA,Jorgensen:,Well I would say with all of our acquisitions that we've done - we've done 4 now if you include Playdemic which is not yet closed you're going to see clearly some synergies synergies in terms of management teams synergies in terms of go-to-market strategies marketing strategies and so forth. Most of these companies are smaller. They are exceptional in how they develop games. But as you've seen with F1 already we've been able to drive more sales than what we've seen historically with that business and we'll continue to do that across all of the portfolio of companies. I would say in the case of Playdemic and in the case of Glu Tap Sports Baseball and Metalhead with their baseball game and Playdemic's golf game we are going to leverage their strengths as best as possible to try to find ways to create more and better casual games in mobile - on mobile than we have in the past. And that's not to say that we haven't done a good job on mobile. We have but the potential that we have - if you look at what Playdemic's done the potential we have with something like a global FIFA game or a global Madden game where we already have the licenses there is huge upside. I can't give you what those numbers look like yet. But I will tell you that the reason we did these deals was to try to make sure we brought the talent in that could help us expand our capabilities on more casual sports games around the globe and more casual games in general around the globe. And we're pretty excited about it. And I'd tell you the mobile teams have worked very closely with the new teams at Playdemic or Glu or Metalhead or Codemasters and they've come up with some amazing ideas on what we could do together.Yes. I would say just on the F1 game I think we've exceeded our expectations. There's no negative on the F1 team because they are exceptional. it was could we quickly - I mean we didn't own the business for that long. So could we quickly integrate the teams our marketing and publishing efforts to try and drive that business as fast as we did? That's probably where we might have had some questions. And actually we've well exceeded that - And it's to the testament of an exceptional game development team that was able to produce the right assets to produce the right marketing materials to help us drive this business and the teams working together. And you know what? I think we don't get enough credit for that. But EA is a bunch of people who really can work well together. And we do a great job of working with other parts of our company. And when we bring in acquisitions we work well with them. And I think the poster child there is you look at Respawn and you look at what's happened with Apex. This is a team effort. And Respawn as obviously driven the amazing development of Apex but they've partnered with us extremely well to drive what is now - it's coming up to almost $2 billion in business over 2 years. That's unheard of in our industry. And I'm not sure we get enough credit for it. I don't really care. But at the end of the day it is amazing what our teams are able to do. I would tell you to your earlier part of the question we've tried to put together great marketing for all of the companies that we've acquired and it doesn't - it happens quick. And F1 has been a great example of that and you have to have great products to do that. And so I would tell you that the combination of great teams and great marketers is really powerful in this industry and I think we've been able to prove that we can do that across all the acquisitions that we've done in the last 4 or 5 years.Yes. And what I would say on the advertising side is right or wrong we've never had a large advertising business. It covers around $100 million a year. Part of that is our strategy that we have not wanted people to leave our network. And if you look at most advertising on mobile it's for other mobile games. And what that means is you're willing to allow people to leave your network to go play somewhere else. We're working with Glu right now and with Playdemic on their views on advertising and we may change our views over time. We think it's important - in no way take my comments of saying we don't think that it's a very profitable business and we should stay close to it but it has not been a huge part of our business historically. So it's upside for us down the road if that's where we want to go. And more to come on that. We're just - we're still in the learning stage relative to how we managed advertising in the past. We know the current rules new rules make it even more challenging. And so we're trying to figure out what are the right ways to do advertising for you to play a world where people are willing to pay via an advertising app or an advertising video or whatever it is versus pay to play the game. And we'll see how that plays out over time.So no cost synergies are included in our guidance. Clearly revenue synergies are occurring as they occur. As you pointed out we did better at F1 than we thought we would. Those are harder to predict. But we haven't yet implanted cost synergies in our OpEx line. For example changes in executives changes in staffing changes - either positive or negative. You should assume that there are going to be some changes and we will layer those into guidance over the next 3 to 6 months. We've been very focused on making sure we're bringing the company in as successful as possible and then determining what is the right way to drive synergies. But I would tell you is - there are potential large synergies across all of the acquisitions we've made which would normally happen but we'll see more of those over the next few quarters and we'll try to keep everyone appraised of that.Well I'll pull Andrew to answer that but I hope we actually get to real people in the stands because we might go the other way right now. So who knows?Yes. I would say that we always have newer players come in as the game grows. Newer players will take steps towards getting more and more involved in Ultimate Team. They don't get involved immediately on day 1 one because they got to understand how to play it; two they got to become part of a social network that's also playing it. And once that happens we start to see growth. And so we see growth during the season. We haven't seen a lot of change in that pre-COVID or post-COVID because it is a way for people to have a social interaction around something that they're really interested in doing. And so we know we've grown the overall franchise across all of ultimate teams. We've grown the overall franchises around the underlying games. And those are the 2 biggest drivers for us to continue to drive Ultimate Team participation and engagement which ultimately results in Ultimate Team spending in some way or another. And so I think we're pretty confident that even during the COVID crisis we continue to see people get more and more engaged. Some of that's driven by the fact that people are simply not at work and physical position. They may be working for home but a lot of it is also the excitement around what we're seeing in the global soccer seasons that we've seen over the last couple of years because there's been a lot of excitement a lot of player movement and that's what gets people really pumped up about playing Ultimate Team.Chris we got time for one more question? Or is that it?Well thank you everybody for your interest and good questions and we look forward to interacting with you over the next couple of months. And hopefully we all get to see each other in person one of these days soon. So - but I appreciate it.,0.090169087,0.349107444,0.149500098
211,211,NEM,Palmer:,I think the type â€“ on the equipment side thatâ€™s the one thatâ€™s been a particular issue for us Josh. I think the area thatâ€™s going to be tight but for supply and costs that we need to monitor as I indicated earlier is going to be labor. I think thatâ€™s going to be a key driver. And obviously some of the consumables just ensuring that weâ€™re managing our â€“ we lead into our global supply chain those long-term relationships and weâ€™re monitoring that very very very closely. Itâ€™s also linked to decisions weâ€™re making to derisk some of our operations. Knowing that this issue is potentially going to be weak the world and the mining industry for some time that decision weâ€™re looking at around the deeper underground to drop down and open up a third level and have more headings from which to be able to take ore is derisking that operation stepping back making investment now to the recent operation to better manage some of this volatility and disruptions coming ahead. So weâ€™re starting to make decisions that help us manage some of these issues going forward.Thanks Josh.Yes. Good morning Tanya. Yes thatâ€™s correct. And if I give you a little bit more color on that about 70 â€“ so itâ€™s 100 000 ounces below the 6.2 million midpoint that weâ€™re starting to see open up. Itâ€™s managed operations that Iâ€™m referring to that are around about 100 000 ounces. 70% of that will come from Subika Underground and the work we do to step back drop down open up that third level and really I was just commenting with Josh to really derisk that operation as we move forward. I think about 20% will come from Cripple Creek and Victor. As we again look to move to that simpler operation just mining and heap leach and incorporate some of the delays that weâ€™ve seen through both the impact of the Omicron surge through the latter part of last year and the start of this year plus the very important decision we took to go to fully vaccinated at that site. So weâ€™ve got some work to do now to get ahead of some of the waste more to open up the ore to get them onto heap-leach pads. And I think the move to a simpler longer life operation will contribute about 20%. And then the remaining 10% weâ€™ve made up across the three Canadian operations that have been pretty significantly disrupted through the first quarter. So Tanya around about 100 000 ounces. 70% will be underground 20% CC&V about 10% Canadian operations.Thatâ€™s correct. Youâ€™ll see when you look at gold production with where weâ€™re mining and kind of see that youâ€™re going to see a bit of a seesaw through the course of the year. So youâ€™ll see â€“ on gold youâ€™ll see it dropped in the second quarter. We will then climb again in the third and it will drop again in the fourth but itâ€™s about evenly weighted across the two halves with a bit of that seesaw effect. So youâ€™re just seeing the different the different metals come through as weâ€™re mining through the different phases of both mines tenant.Certainly coming out the other side I might just quickly work through the four regions Tanya. Coming out the other side certainly in Canada except for Iâ€™d say Ã‰lÃ©onore where we are still very strict with our protocols of testing and isolating because of our close connections with the First Nation communities around that mine. So we have kept some pretty stringent controls in place at early on. But in general certainly see Canada and in the U.S. Cripple Creek and Victor open up. Ghana is common as in its progressing well. Australia is where â€“ I think Australia in general is a wash with the virus at the moment. So April is still being impacted through Tanami and Boddington but starting to come out the other side of that is the youâ€™re really getting to mill in the communities in around Australia. PeÃ±asquito is solid and pretty solid through Merian [ph] Yanacocha and Cerro Negro in terms of being the other side of the [indiscernible].Weâ€™ve got contract negotiations in process currently in Ghana. Mexico scheduled for July Peru is in process and then Surinam itâ€™s been delayed and then weâ€™ve got a number of sites that arenâ€™t covered by collective agreements. So theyâ€™re active but thereâ€™s nothing that weâ€™re seeing unusual in terms of how those negotiations are proceeding.Thatâ€™s correct Tanya.Weâ€™re pretty much seeing that across the board and itâ€™s been driven by whatâ€™s happening with the price of natural gas across the board. So itâ€™s a little bit different driver than I guess normal because of the circumstances.Thanks Lawson.Good morning Greg Iâ€™ll pick that up and maybe Rob Iâ€™ll throw to you for a little bit more color. So the key capital projects â€“ so maybe just talk through the three of them Greg the three key ones that really drive that development capital spend. Tanami 2 we are certainly seeing impacts on that specialized labor that we will need to line that shaft. And we are now in a matter of a month or two away from having completed the reading of the 1.5 kilometers the air frame is nearing completion as well. And we set up then for the next couple of years to line that shaft in order to complete it. So getting that specialized labor to site set ready to go for what is a very specialized job in line in that shaft is key. We have an important milestone as we finish the reaming and that shaft to the pause and understand that program of work both schedule and cost to fit that out. So I would say in the third quarter in a good position to say this is what the run to home looks like. There will be some impacts but weâ€™ll have a pretty good view of that within a matter of a couple of months. But itâ€™s more going to be on the specialized labor that we need to get there. Thatâ€™s going to drive Tanami 2. Greg Iâ€™ll pause on each one. Rob did you want to build any color on Tanami 2?And then Ahafo North engineering is 90% complete and procurement 60% [ph] completeness as Rob indicated earlier answer to a question. Weâ€™ve got a lot of the key heavy mobile equipment landed in Ghana now. So we are really getting into that getting the land access. Weâ€™re getting into the serious business of breaking ground and starting to do the civil works. And then start to build them open up the mind build a processing facility. So again for that one getting that clear date where we have unfettered access to that land which will happen through the second quarter thatâ€™s the important milestone for us to then step back and understand what that schedule looks like to have that equipment thatâ€™s there. The engineering gives us more definitive pricing to then have a clear view of that project by schedule and cost. So probably similar timing to Tanami 2 during the third quarter I think weâ€™ll be in a good position to give an update based upon those two key milestones. Rob getting there anything you add on Ahafo.And then the third one is Yanacocha Sulfides I think given what weâ€™re seeing in the world fortuitously the decisions we made that were driven by the pandemic to pause the or to delay the full funds approval but to continue with committing to â€“ we committed to move forward with 23 major equipment packages and weâ€™ve locked in factory slots and a lot of instances pricing for key pieces of equipment oxygen plants mills electric motors the autoclave the core part of the pressure oxidation circuit. The autoclave vessel will actually be on the ground Yanacocha by the end of this year. So weâ€™ve been able to derisk a number of elements of that project by making the decision to commit to some of those packages of work. Engineering is around 50% complete. Weâ€™ve got camp construction well advanced. So thereâ€™s a bunch of stuff weâ€™re doing to de-risk that project whilst we move towards full funds. And we are working very closely with Bechtel to understand the inflationary pressures around the other things that come with that project as we gear up with both a labor a construction workforce and then all of the other pieces that you need to build that facility as we take that engineering that detailed engineering and work out detailed costs. So thatâ€™s important input to the full front decision later this year. Rob anything add for that?Greg does that give you the sort of color youâ€™re looking for?More Q4 Greg weâ€™ll flick as the engineer say weâ€™ll flick the line on the engineering in the next month or so drop out drop out all those detailed schedules. And then you've got quite an extensive piece of work to do basically cost and schedule estimate to build towards the full funds decision. So thatâ€™ll consume the third quarter so itâ€™ll be end of the fourth quarter before you have all of that come together but certainly the other two projects in the third quarter.There's certainly elements that the mining industry are talking about in terms of that cost escalation we've been able to avoid because of the procurement weâ€™ve got underway and the engineering that weâ€™ve done and the like. However so the issue for us is more that the pandemic has impacted the pace at which you can do the work. And so for us itâ€™s going to be as we actually as we pause at those milestones and understand the work going forward you â€“ and you look at what the schedule is against what we assumed it to be. For us itâ€™s probably going to be more an issue of the indirect costs that you carry for potentially a longer period of time than youâ€™d assume. So thatâ€™s going to be a factor for us and weâ€™ll see elements I think weâ€™ll see elements for aligning of a shaft and that specialized labor that weâ€™ll have some cost escalation. So sort of jumping around it a bit Greg I think thereâ€™ll be an element of it. And thereâ€™s an element thatâ€™s pandemic related given we were into those projects. I donâ€™t know if Rob whether you wanted to.You â€“ Greg I think given the capital projects we hit those milestones and have those definitive schedules and then costs I think probably better to wait and give you the definitive numbers as they apply to those two projects rather than sort of just throw out a number thatâ€™s a bit more generic.Thanks Greg.Just before you move on weâ€™ll stay on the line until weâ€™re exhausted until everyoneâ€™s question so more than welcome to stay on. But weâ€™ll stay here until everyoneâ€™s asked their question. Sorry operator.Thanks Fahad.Good morning Anita. Yes I think youâ€™re â€“ in terms of that spend profile I think youâ€™re describing it. Well I think youâ€™re still going to see that similar weighting first or second half the nature of these projects that spend will just flow into the following year and the following year weâ€™ll flow forward into the year after that. So I think itâ€™ll be an element of maybe a bit more spend next year. But I think youâ€™ll also see that itâ€™ll move into 2024 as well. So itâ€™s just that felt like moving forward. Still progressing towards the end of the year full funds decision for sulfides. And once that full funds decision is taken camp will be complete. So itâ€™ll have beds for 4 000 people Bechtel are gearing up. And we basically Bechtel higher the workforce directly for a lot of that work. And so with the assumption we get a full funds decision at the end of the year we will gear up and start to ramp up into 2023. So I wouldnâ€™t see a delay in us starting to break ground seriously on sulfides [ph].Thanks Anita. What I might do is give you a bit of a general overview on that note to get Rob just to give a bit of a color on some of those operations. But I think itâ€™s we talk about the direct impacts from the pandemic the Omicron surge in terms of labor availability in a particular quarter and costs and the like. But youâ€™re also seeing what Iâ€™d call the indirect impacts where this pandemic has been chronic. And so your mine sequences are different from what they wouldâ€™ve otherwise been if you were just have unfettered access to run your business as normal. So some of that grade discrepancies is the mine sequence and where you are in a particular month or quarter compared to where you assumed you would be where certainly as we get the stronger second half of this year part of that is linked to moving into higher grades. And Rob I donâ€™t know if you wanted to pick up PeÃ±asquito Cripple Creek & Victor and or indeed more than happy to go offline with you and stick through some of that detail for you as well.Yes. Up to two years thereâ€™s other operations which have been relatively unaffected but the worst is up to two years. Thereâ€™s so much may only be six months.Thanks Anita.Yes. Good morning Adam. When you look at our yearly cost guidance we donâ€™t assume any inflation in those numbers. Theyâ€™re unescalated. So if it was a standard year that we were seeing before this pandemic we would typically have 2% to 3% escalation with them to get built into that number as we built towards guiding for next year. What we are seeing is unprecedented in terms of whatâ€™s playing out in the world with the combination of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. So in terms of what look like next year I think weâ€™ve got to see more of how a few key events play out this year. Whatâ€™s going to happen with the pandemic other supply chains going to settle down is whatâ€™s going to play out in Ukraine? And as we start our work actually next week with our key leaders around the business starting to map out our business plan and we build towards in October Board Meeting to approve the plan and then regarding in December. So the coming months are ones in which we will step back look at whatâ€™s happening on a macroeconomic sense. Whatâ€™s structural whatâ€™s cyclical what is 2023 looking like? And therefore what are our unit costs going to look like next year? So thatâ€™s how and we look atâ€¦I think we are in unchartered territories Adam and it's â€“ I think you've seen throughout the â€“ in terms of what I'm observing in the mining industry as folks are out reporting a very very similar commentary so an unchartered territory. I still as we look at macroeconomics and after the debate still see it as more cyclical and a long cycle than structural. But we are in unchartered territories so I would say that there's some caution.Roughly speaking a couple of years inflationary cycles but I'm really drawing on straw here.It's just a circumstance that is unprecedented in modern history.Sorry canâ€™t help you Adam.Yes. Good morning Mike the delay for some of that key equipment that drills that have been particularly problematic for us is that is manufacturing. So it's actually getting the drill in the queue and manufacture. So it's the labor availability within those shops and then having the materials you need to â€“ aggregate those drills and then have them come out the door. So what has Rob is indicating we've got all of the heavy mobile equipment for a Ahafo North on the ground in Ghana. So although there are challenges with logistics and freight we can get from a manufacturer's warehouse to our facilities albeit with some delays. But the key issue is within the manufacturing shop. Robert do you want to build on that?Thanks Mike.Good morning Cleve and a very good question. We are actively debating that now. I think it is â€“ we are now seeing I think in the same way that we're working our way through the inflation piece as you indicated and as Adam was trying to explore and understand that inflationary piece is driving gold price. We're now seeing gold price at current levels and as we start to get in amongst our macroeconomics and start to have our internal debate starts to do our business planning work. Where is gold price heading and what does the flow look like for gold price is the debate that is active with us now and we'll be having that debate over the coming months as we think about whether we're getting into the zone where it's time to look at resetting the floor for gold price.It's certainly something we are actively debating around whether it's something we incorporate into our planning processes this year. As you unpack the macroeconomics around gold you are seeing some fundamental shifts.Yes. It's a bit â€“ I might just pass across to Rob who manages the very close relationships with those key EPCM contractors but â€“ It's a bit variable across the projects so to speak. It is clear depending on what we're doing there's some things that you lock in without a doubt. And we much prefer making sure that we've got things â€“ we've got that confidence in clarity. But we've got other areas such as we've explained before where the labor costs have gone up the materials are capped the manufacturing is capped but it's the labor costs which are flexible. So we typically like to have full confidence and full knowledge of what we're planning but it's a little bit bearable and depending on the work that we're doing.Thanks. Clearly a very important decision we took and I think very few other companies have taken but I'm so glad we took the decision is to require every person who works at Newmont to be fully vaccinated. We lost 25 colleagues to this virus over the last two and half years. And through the Omicron surge we had one person hospitalized with an underlying health condition. And you saw the spike in those positive cases and us having made that decision has saved lives. And that is going to put us in good stead going forward for future waves because we have a workforce that is now highly resilient. So that is going to put us in a good position. Rob did you want to maybe talk about how we think about managing the ability to open up or tighten up our protocols. And obviously underlying workforce as fully vaccinated gives us a lot of confidence in decisions we made?Thanks Cleve.Thanks Michael.Yes. Thanks Brian. You are honing in quite nicely. It is predominantly cost-driven. And if you were to model on all-in sustaining cost per gold ounce I'd probably use 5%. And I think we will get some benefit as we then come back to our total metal profile with a good another 1.5 million ounces of gold equivalent ounces of how those metal prices play out in terms of how you calculate a GEO that will give you some benefit in the unit costs. And maybe a bit lighter than the 5% as you are quite rightly pointing out.Thanks Brian.Thanks Tanya. You're certainly seeing â€“ what we saw play out in the first quarter was escalation or inflation at the levels that we'd assumed. So it's really as we sell more of a production story related to the Omicron surge that is around Q1. And we now pivot into more of a cost story and additional inflation as we move into the remaining three quarters of the year. So you're starting to see in this quarter those higher diesel prices flow through. And just to clarify we don't hedge any of our oil. So it's spot price that youâ€™ll see flow through in our cost base. So you're certainly seeing that oil price in our costs as we're into the second quarter moving forward.Yes. That sounds great.Thanks Tanya.I think we might be good to finish up operator by the looks of it.Thank you operator and thank you everyone for taking the extra time to work through our call with us today and please have a lovely weekend. And I look forward to catching up with you on our analyst roundtable in a couple of weekâ€™s time. Thanks everyone.,0.00298061,0.004688144,0.000656238
212,212,AMP,Cracchiolo:,I can't really give you a percentage but certainly exiting the living benefits we'll certainly eliminate that aspect of but we are seeing strength in the SDA product. So I can't really give you the exact proportionality on them Tom.Yeah. So the one-year performance so we know it's more of what had occurred more quickly. It didn't really affect the flow situation in that regard. I think the flows - and you can see it across the industry. You're going to have a little pickup of redemptions as people say hey maybe I need to get out. And they particularly if you look at fixed income there's been a major pull out on some sectors of the fixed income market including munis et cetera. You also had a bit slowing of people investing in let's say growth stocks at this point in time based upon how they've pulled back. So I think that should be expected. I think as you see more people reporting you're going to see that. I think you can see that in the SIMS data. What I did say is that our level of flows is consistent with the industry. We were 1% better in equities. We're looking at the US and we're 1% worsed in fixed income. And I mentioned the difference in the segment. So I actually don't think we had a major full up compared to the industry. I think the industry is falling off as well. Now the other point -- and this is active. We're talking about active. Now the other thing I would say is on the performance side there are three things that occur: number one in Europe there isn't a segment that calls growth and value and they - it's all meshed together. We have a little more of a growth quality bias versus more of a value. And so when you look at the European and your benchmark we had a little more underperformance there because we're a little more growth oriented. Our institution and our retail clients understand that a little more. But on the benchmarking it just shows that your performance goes down. Then in the US we have one big fund which is the 50th. It's not way below. It just dropped and it will go back. It's a few basis points and that's what caused the little of the US in equities. And then in fixed income you could imagine with the pullback of the bond market. You had a little more dislocation there and a few basis points is what tips the thing. But we feel very good about the quality of those portfolios. And therefore we feel like that will bounce back as well. So we don't feel like there's a major change. And again when you look at a quarter within a one year versus three five and 10 years of having really strong performance I don't think that has an effect. And I think particularly in institutional clients understand a little more of what's underlying the portfolio and so I think that is also very important.Yeah. So let me take a shot maybe a clearly the interest rate environment improves as you look at long-term care and other aspects of that. And as it relates to risk transfer there's clearly in our opinion a more active interest in these sort of products and you're seeing that. So yeah those two aspects combined to certainly have a higher profile for people looking at books of that nature. These are long complicated transactions. Again you've seen it with many of the things that have been now how long they have taken. So I'm going to put a time frame on them. Like I said we're starting off in a very good position. We have great products and we just - with people expressing interest we basically evaluate from that standpoint. So it's - but the environment is certainly beneficial at this stage.So Alex I think what I would say is over years our total asset levels have gone up. And so to your point our cash levels have risen in consistency with that. I think what I would say if I even look at over the course of the year or from the first quarter et cetera we're up a few billion dollars as we sort of - usually what you have is a little more of a draw down in the first quarter as more money goes back into work from the end of the year and stuff. And what we've seen is a little more of a pickup. So I would probably say to the effect if people will put some more money back into the bond market or whatever or keep a little less cash on the hold. But I donâ€™t see it materially going down because we didnâ€™t really increase it as far as positional cash that much in that sense. I think to your point itâ€™s maintained as a percentage of total assets. Our advisors have been very good about the rebalancing of portfolios and keeping that money active. But I would say yeah it's gone up a few billion dollars from where I would probably normally think it would be at this juncture. But I don't see it falling dramatically from there because to Walter's point it's positional it's transactional. It's keeping some emergency cash levels that we think is important from a client perspective to have.Yeah Suneet I think it's also based on what happens in the environment in the market but we have flexibility. We've deployed that flexibility at the right times where we feel it made sense. But I think on the other side of to Walter's point we've given you a little bit of a targeted range that we feel at this juncture up and down will still make sense. But there is opportunity for us to deploy if necessary or we want to based on opportunities.I think one of the things I would say and Walter could complement. So first of all we've added the BMO business which is an institutional business and it does have with some of its alternatives and real estate et cetera. So if someone said well you have the same performance fees you had two years ago the answer is no we should have a larger number of performance fees maybe not as a percentage of the total asset base. But more in total dollars because there's more product that have performance fees on them. But that's lumpy. And it's also based upon when things get accrued or when it gets liquidated et cetera. So Walter I don't...Well what I would say Suneet is this. One is yes there's always the upside you mentioned there. The other thing I would probably say is we have not if you looked at us even over the last few years when the market has been really good we have not grown our expense base normally at a much higher rate. I think some other companies have and might have to really deal with that. I think we haven't. I mean even look at Columbia Threadneedle outside of the increase in expenses go BMO was added their expenses were relatively flat in the quarter year-over-year. Same thing we're up only a few percent in Advice & Wealth with all that growth of that business and the investments we have made. So I would say that we will turn the spigot so to speak if we feel like things are weakening. But I would also say that we still have good activity and therefore we want to make sure we handle that well and support the business well. So I think you got to - we're looking at what that balance is but we haven't been overly high on the expense growth. But if we feel like things have really -- well activity has gone down and yeah we'll tighten those expenses.,0.002801016,0.002967477,0.000146479
213,213,TTD,Green:,You bet. Thanks Shyam. Appreciate it. So I â€“ as I look at the outperformance for this quarter and I just look at all the things that would write in this quarter itâ€™s hard not to start with connected television. I mentioned in the prepared remarks the CTV had more positive changes than ever. And I donâ€™t know that I could have made up a better script in terms of just seeing companies like HBO move from sort of testing phase to scale. And then Netflix and Disney+ talking about ads were really created in an environment that is really optimal for ads. And of course we already had great relationships with Paramount and Peacock and Sky and so many of those that you think of as the AVOD leaders to now have really everybody entering into this world of choice that is driven by ads. Itâ€™s just a very exciting phenomenon. But Iâ€™m also just very encouraged by the fact that of course thereâ€™s macro pressures and noise and uncertainty that everybody has seen costs from war and inflation. And of course the stock market bouncing around a lot. But in that environment what weâ€™ve historically seen is that the moment when CMOs and marketers get very deliberate about where theyâ€™re going to spend money and they become very data-driven in the choices that theyâ€™re making. And in our case that means theyâ€™re spending more with us. So Iâ€™m just incredibly encouraged by all the things that we're â€“weâ€™ve seen this quarter and how it sets it up for the rest of the year which gets to the second half of your question. So with all these moves in advertising especially from the global players of CTV I think it really sets up the second half of the year for â€“ around the world to see movement towards ad-funded CTV in a way that we started seeing early on in the pandemic. But I think weâ€™re seeing even more of now. We didnâ€™t spend a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about shopper data. In the first quarter of this year we also just had our first full quarter with Walmart and their DSP whoâ€™s just doing really well. We have talked about new partnerships with Walgreens and Drizly. There have been others that have talked about our partnership with Targetâ€™s media company Roundel. So to have Walgreens Walmart and Target on the platform and partners as it relates to data and measurement just unbelievable. But just again nearing a perfect setup as it relates to shopper partnerships. And then of course in the second half of the year weâ€™re also going to have a midterm election. From recent events that seems to be one thatâ€™s going to be exciting as well. And I suspect just because of the momentum and attention that it will have more investment than most. And we think itâ€™s â€“ weâ€™re very well positioned to have it be our biggest political year ever. Solimar is now over 80% adoption. So weâ€™ll finish that by the end of the year. So in other words weâ€™ll move everything over to Solimar the platform that we shipped on July 7 7/7 last year. To go from launch to 100% adoption the following year is something that we were aiming for but now weâ€™re extremely confident that weâ€™ll hit. And then we spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks talking about UID and OpenPath. I mean we mentioned a longer list of names on OpenPath but we didnâ€™t mention those that we mentioned in the press release just a couple of days ago. Buzzfeed L.A. Times Forbes MediaVine Red Ventures which includes CNET and a whole bunch of others have also been added to it just since last quarter that we announced publicly sent. So all of those amount to some amazing contributors to the second â€“ or to the remainder of the year say second half but to the remainder of the year.First of all I appreciate the congratulations. Weâ€™re extremely excited about the results and as well as just all the things going in our direction most notably on CTV. So appreciate that sentiment. So first let me just address head on the concern that you raised in your first question. Will CPMs be lower as a result of this additional inventory? And can I just describe a little bit the demand? So the demand is really off the charts. And itâ€™s in large part because people are moving away from traditional cable television where there are just tons of ads and youâ€™re paying more and getting less than you have in a very long time. And so as a result when youâ€™re adding new inventory itâ€™s desperately needed. Thereâ€™s demand already lined up. And the thing that is really great about the way that we're seeing players like Disney or what Iâ€™anticipate Netflix will do or HBO Max and then those that have been doing it for a while is that theyâ€™re of course in order to continue subscribers which is the way that they continue to gain subscribers which is the way theyâ€™re all graded they have to have a great ad experience. They canâ€™t alienate users. That means that they have to provide relevance and they have to provide very few ads. So that means weâ€™re going to see scarcity for a while for as far as we can see in the future honestly. And that means that there will be demand and that it is the best way for them to get incremental subscribers. Because I believe that those economics are becoming obvious â€“ as obvious to everyone so much so that the biggest names in the business seem to pivot very quickly that weâ€™re just SVOD I donâ€™t think itâ€™s strategically smart for anybody whoâ€™s just entering the space now to start with SVOD only. Itâ€™s like any product where over time as it evolves if you launch the iPhone today or a new smartphone and it doesnâ€™t have features that rivals the iPhone 13 and instead it rivals the features of iPhone 1 youâ€™re just not going to be competitive. Youâ€™ve got to be at parity with the current state of the market. The current way to compete is to offer consumers choice. And I believe that that becomes increasingly important for anybody entering streaming wars with hopes of competing with the biggest players in the space.Yes. Sounds great. Iâ€™m going to ask Blake to actually take a stand of both of them and then Iâ€™ll also take time with both of them. So Blake?Yes. So first I agree with everything Blake just said. He covered almost all of it. Iâ€™ll just add a little bit more color. So first Iâ€™ve been to Europe twice in the last 4-ish months and thatâ€™s in large part because thereâ€™s just such an opportunity shaping up in connected television. In various markets weâ€™re seeing just a lot of movement from even some of the companies that previously hadnâ€™t embraced ads and certainly programmatic open Internet ads and are now doing just that. And now with pressure from some of the biggest global players weâ€™re seeing them move relatively quickly which is why we saw CTV up over 2x in Q1 in EMEA. So just very excited by the momentum. Even in the very rare cases where thereâ€™s pauses or thereâ€™s â€“ Iâ€™ve seen some supply chains coming from Ukraine that are a little bit more affected in EMEA the sentiment is very positive as it relates to their intentions to spend with us in the rest of the year. So Iâ€™ve got both of the trips in the last 4 months more positive than when I got there and believing that what most people are doing is exactly what we described in the prepared remarks which is when thereâ€™s some economic pressure or they have to do more with less they become very data-driven and they become closer partners of ours during that time. And thatâ€™s exactly what Iâ€™m seeing everywhere around the world and maybe as much in EMEA as anywhere else. On the political Iâ€™ll just underline what Blake said on â€“ the seasonality is a little bit different in midterm and election than it is in the presidential election. So we expect to see more hit the second half. We also heard similar reports of just this potentially being record-setting for political on the macro. But Iâ€™ll just say lastly on the political we â€“ Iâ€™m really proud of what weâ€™ve proven in the last couple of election cycles which is that we can objectively represent the Democratic party as well as the Republican party that we can support a fair process and that buying in programmatic and in a data-driven way thereâ€™s room for both parties to run a better process than what they have in other mediums including in some cases in social. So weâ€™re really excited about what weâ€™ve proven in the past and believe that weâ€™ve set ourselves up to do more for both parties and even the more independent than what we have ever done before. So excited about what that means for the second half of the year in particular.Yes. So I think your assessment sort of thatâ€™s built into your question is spot on. I just â€“ I believe the tolerance for conflict of interest among media companies and technology companies is lower than in almost any other place. So I think itâ€™s really interesting that Google decided to go to the upfronts this year. They scheduled their upfronts right on top of Disneyâ€™s of which is just sort of bad form and certainly not a way to win friends. And I think thatâ€™s somewhat representative of the way they are being received among many of the media companies. So I think itâ€™s just such an amazing backdrop for us to be in the CTV space being one of and in many cases the very biggest provider of ad demand for some of the biggest media companies in the world and theyâ€™re leaning into our partnerships in a way they have never before. Itâ€™s just really incredible. And thatâ€™s largely because they know who we are. We are very clear on the value that we provide. We are not trying to compete with them. We donâ€™t own any content. We are constantly â€“ well publicly and privately reassuring them that we will not own content. And we do that so that we can create a more effective supply chain but also so that we can partner with them and just be very upfront about who we are and what we do because we think thatâ€™s the best way to be competitive today. And so because we think that they are to some extent doing the exact same thing they â€“ even companies like that that were somewhat hybrid content and technology companies have largely become a content manufacturing machine. And so it just creates opportunity for us to partner because weâ€™re all becoming very clear on who we are and what we do rather than some tech behemoth that wants to be everything right? And Amazon competes with nearly every business and the S&P 500 at this point. And I think that becomes increasingly problematic especially in the intersection of media and tech.You bet. So in terms of loyal signed-on users it's actually a fairly complicated question because there is a question of how many users are signed on but then there's also like how connected are those to sign-ins on other websites. So to sort of boil it down to what I think is the most important and easiest to explain concept there is some amount of the Internet that needs to be logged in in order to create the ability to model or predict what's happening on the rest of it. Instantly this is exactly the same way that companies that use log-ins today like Google or Facebook as they're a primary identity mechanism rather than cookies. That's exactly why they're in a good position is that they'll use that and then model on some additional percentage. In general we've seen this from some of the independent data companies. You really need only about 10% to be logged in in order to model well on all the rest of it. I actually think that the numbers can end up being much much higher than that in terms of what will actually be logged in and what will actually be available on UID if the trends that we predict continue. So that's the first part of your question. On the -- can you remind me the second part of your question?,0.002732893,0.003425062,0.000317558
214,214,GWW,Macpherson:,Yes. We've been making a strategic pivot with that business for the last several years dramatically expanding the product line building new data analytics capabilities getting that business independent from a technology stack. So there's been a lot of investment that's happened. In terms of the question specifically you're asking we have done a whole bunch of analysis working with the team in Japan on customer profitability. And customer profitability not in terms of the first transaction but in terms of lifetime value. And we are skewing our efforts to attractive business customers. And so what you've seen is dropped some volume that we certainly could have in the short term because it's just not helpful in terms of creating a profitable long-term business. I think ultimately it actually will accelerate our growth rate as we get better at acquiring and getting attractive customers to the second third order where they become more frequent buyers. But certainly we have made a little bit of a shift in getting out of some channels that were lower lifetime.I think the price volume wasn't much different than what we saw in the whole business that we talked about before. So high single-digit price and substantial volume growth is what we're seeing in that business at this point.Yes. It's a great question. I think what I'm hearing from customers is most of the work that we've done has been highly valued to support their operations and to keep them up and running. And in many cases we've actually added inventory management solutions to our KeepStock solutions or further embedded in customers really really want to continue to have long-term relationships. So you could argue there may be some pullback but that's really not the behavior we're seeing and it's not what we're hearing from our customers. Our customers are saying if anything we've learned a whole lot about who we want to partner with and why we want to partner with them through this. And our ability to keep customers going is super valued and I think it will continue to help us be sticky with those customers.Yes. Dee why don't you -- do you want to jump in? I can not hear you Dee. I can take it then. So what we basically have been looking at is we took price obviously through some of the back half of last year as well as everybody has. We think prices will moderate a bit. So we don't think the level we're at will be the full-year number year-over-year because we think that the price increases will moderate. That doesn't mean prices will go down they won't. But relative to some of the changes that we made last year you'll start to see a bit slower -- a lower difference. So we would expect them to moderate somewhat still a pretty healthy price obviously this year.Sure. Thanks everybody for joining us. It is a pleasure to have you on and hope you're all doing well. I would just reiterate the fact that we're completely focused on what we can control and that's making sure we advance our strategic initiatives to grow profitably. Building the culture we think is really really important and making sure that we serve our customers well. And while there are many things going on the market right now is very very strong and we feel good about the share gain performance we're getting. We feel good about what we're seeing in both models. And really optimistic for the future. So thanks. I hope you all have a great rest of the week and take care.,0.211579114,0.42043364,0.208854526
215,215,PPG,McGarry:,Yes. First of all let me touch on the packaging. Look we have picked up new share at I would say 70% of the new beverage can plants. So we are in very good shape from that going forward. Second when you look at the packaging numbers you have to remember we had phenomenal comps last year and that will make it more difficult. But our packaging overall growth this year is going to be quite good. So I feel very good about our position in our packaging coatings business. I would also tell you that when I think about that business itâ€™s not just the volume itâ€™s also the price that we are realizing as well.Yes. So we will take the easy one first CapEx. We had CapEx spending in December that we donâ€™t pay for until January. So the January number was probably a little bit inflated but our overall spend for the year is not going to change. And we are still looking at that 3% $500 million kind of range. So we feel good about that. As you know some â€“ a little bit of that is catch-up from the under-spending in â€˜20 and a little bit of early 2021. So from a manufacturing standpoint we had about $0.20 in Q4. We probably had about half of that in Q1. And the problem is itâ€™s not that we are having challenges making things itâ€™s we are having challenges scheduling things because of raw materials predictability what comes in. And if you are missing one item you canâ€™t make the paint. So thatâ€™s a bigger issue. And of course some of it is also energy at the plant. So as you can imagine going into Q1 we had a certain natural gas number for Europe. And we are well in excess of that once the war broke out. So I would tell you overall the manufacturing is getting better. And I would say for Q2 you should anticipate another 50% improvement in that number.Okay. So PJ I will take the emulsions question. We as part of our Traffic Solutions or Ennis-Flint acquisition it came with a small resin plant. So we are making more emulsions there. We think we can increase the size of that facility. So the team is working to do that as well. So not only we are going to use the asset it was running five days a week one shift now itâ€™s running 24 hours a day seven days a week. And we are going to improve the size of that. So we are able to get Ba and some of these other raw materials that go into making the emulsion. So the availability is better there. And so we feel comfortable that we are going to continue to improve the utilization of that facility.Okay. Letâ€™s start with manufacturing. I would say theâ€“ the auto guys have gotten better at knowing what chips are coming in and when they are coming in. So they are much better. They are having much less scheduled or unscheduled downtime it should be phrased. So our manufacturing has gotten better because their predictability of running has gotten better. And the one question nobody asked so I am going to throw the answer out there and make sure you know it is our automotive team has priced higher than company average. So I feel really good about that where we are in that space. And then from an EV standpoint we donâ€™t see battery shortages this year. Itâ€™s certainly a longer term trend that we are going to be paying close attention to. But right now when I think about where we are winning in that space our protective coatings that go into the battery has been a huge win for us. We just picked up two world-class customers this quarter. Dielectric powders is another area that we are winning in. And so I feel very comfortable about that. So one of the top five guys we are also running a long-term cathode binder study with thatâ€™s more like a 3-year to 5-year program but the fact that they came to us to do that is really a good sign about how they see us playing in this space long term. So I am very comfortable with the pace that EVs are growing and our ability to service that market.Okay. Jaideep we will start with the new builds. Our marine business is up substantially and itâ€™s going to continue to grow. New builds are up 20% year-over-year and itâ€™s up strongest in China which is where we are strongest. So this is a good market for us. The oil and gas assets that are going to be built because of the Russia war on Ukraine are also going to increase. So thatâ€™s really good for us. LNG tankers are really good for us. This is an area where pool fires lead to a product that we sell that are best-in-class. So I have high hopes for our teams our Protective/Marine business over time that is continuing to do well. When you talk about the auto business fixed costs we actually paint EV cars just like you paint an internal combustion cars. So we are going to still have all that business and fortunately you sell additional paint for the battery box. So actually your fixed â€“ your cost structure improves as the volume goes through. So the transition from internal combustion engines to batteries is actually a good trend for us. And we are leading in the space in this area. So we are doing â€“ I would say we are doing better than our typical market share on internal combustion engines. Now will we look at acquisitions in that space we are always looking for things that add shareholder value. So I would tell you that we are always interested. It is a highly competitive space right now. There is a number of people playing in it whether itâ€™s the protective coatings whether itâ€™s films whether itâ€™s powders whether itâ€™s thermal gap fillers there is a variety of different applications on how you win in that space but we feel very good about this.,0.331466417,0.986243308,0.462997468
216,216,FAST,Lewis:,I would probably add to that. I mean if you see the growth in our web for instance right? I mean you're having better than 50% growth at BDI within that and that creates certain efficiencies for us when you're seeing that much growth there. The web component is also growing north of 50% and that's allowing us to address certain types of customers in a much more efficient way for us. So I think you're seeing there also introduces some of that. And then some of doing right the LIFT is still a relatively small component but it's -- we're getting aggressive with it and we're growing it faster and we'll continue to do so. That's going to bring efficiencies into the field in terms of how they supply the vending and frankly the FMI as well over time right? And so that's going to bring efficiencies to how we use our time. And I would say the things we've talked about with regards to our branches also is trying to bring efficiencies and focus to how we prioritize there. So it's really a combination of the technologies Dan talked about and some of the strategies all of which are really aimed at what we talked about earlier which is making sure that our labor productivity goes up over time.Now if memory serves I think the 50 basis points might have related specifically to mix as opposed to the overall gross margin. But I think the expectation was that gross margin would sort of lean down over the course of the year. I would tend to agree with you that the first quarter was a good start to the year on gross margin. And would it surprise me if that improves the overall annual picture a little bit and pushes us closer to something that's flat for the year? Yes that wouldn't surprise me. And I want to give some credit because one of the reasons I think that we came out stronger this quarter really does relate to the job the field is doing on freight revenue. Freight revenue in the first quarter is up 37%. And it was at a dollar level that we haven't seen before. And that really allowed us to narrow the losses that we -- that I otherwise expected to see. I mean I expected the losses related to our branch freight to be about $3.5 million higher than they turned out to be. And I think that that relates to real efforts on the part of the field and the strategies that we put in place to try to improve that freight profile and I expect it to sort of carry through for the rest of the year. So that's probably the piece that provided more upside relative to my expectations in the first quarter. And the good news is I think that's going to sort of carry through for the rest of the year as well.Yes. And actually if I could just add one more thing to my prior question I won't count it against you. I want to make sure that when I think about gross margin being flattish or in that ballpark for the year make sure you're including the write-down from last year because I'm comparing against that number including that number just so we're all on the same page. To your question about fastener margin yes we haven't necessarily broken it out by product line in that fashion. What I would tell you is the inflation that exists in fasteners is is probably twice or more that of what we're seeing in the non-fastener lines. And even though we might be a touch below neutral on the fastener line from a price cost standpoint in order to achieve that it's fair to assume that the pricing component would be greater for fasteners than it is for the non-fastener piece. And so I think there's probably a bit more balance between product and price as it relates to the fastener side of the ledger.The other thing I might add to that is we've also talked in prior quarters about how we tend to get sort of obsessive about growth drivers on site. Those aren't going well what's that mean for market share et cetera. And what we've commented before is we meet the customer where they're at. And for the last couple of years our Onsite signings have been relatively low but we've been able to gain share through other means because customers are asking us for different things. I think we should all be encouraged by the fact that as the environment does perhaps become a little less chaotic and therefore a little easier for everyone to navigate and maybe that changes the dynamics a little bit. By the same token we just signed a record number of Onsites. And so if one element begins to normalize I think that we're going to have coming up from behind those Onsites growing in the mix at a faster rate driving market share from our more traditional growth drivers at the same time. So one might normalize a bit but I think the other one comes up.Not really. When 92% of your top 100 are growing there's not many that's not. Even areas I would say like oil and gas and areas that have been a little bit sluggish they're not necessarily where everything else is but they're doing better. But I think the marketplace is pretty uniformly strong Jake. It's hard for me to define many areas of significant weakness. And I'm not -- again we don't have a lot of visibility into the future but the field still remains pretty optimistic about how things are playing out.Our goal has always been to achieve a 20% to 25% and to expand our margin a little bit from where we are and that remains our goal. I'll let you model it however you model it based on what you've heard so far. I think we've given you enough to play with. But we feel good about how the business is performing today. And we'll see how the macro environment plays out the rest of the year but we feel pretty good about how things are playing out.And when we talked about the supply chain being fairly predictable at this point there are components to that. What I will say is you are seeing the time it takes to get product from a port in China through to our hubs has actually begun to shorten. However the time that it takes to sort of put in a PO with a manufacturer overseas and then get it to the port that actually has begun to lengthen. And I suspect that's a little bit of what you're seeing the impact of COVID over there. So there's a little bit of a difference there. But as Dan indicated I think the fact that we've been purchasing and floating over so much product over the past six nine months and that's now really beginning to hit the hubs nicely that's going to provide us a fairly decent runway of insulation from some of that.Yes.,0.00504151,0.010991812,0.003457063
217,217,KMI,Kean:,Yes. As we've talked about in the past we have a regas customer at that location who is paying for that capacity. Obviously in today's market that's not in high use not in use generally at all but we have a customer and they're a paying customer and they reserve the capacity and we made a deal. Now we will work with that customer to see if there's something that would allow us to bring the potential for a brownfield liquefaction opportunity forward but we don't have anything to announce there today.Yes. No. I mean I think we're thinking a minimum of 10 years and we'll plan to sell all of this capacity. I think the market wants it. I think like honestly we maybe will be oversubscribed. So I think it's a good opportunity fully sell the project out both projects.Yes. Again we're reluctant -- this -- we're very -- in a very competitive situation Becca. I think what is fair to say is what I said which is we're prepared.Yes. So it's first of all really important on the -- and I know you're not asking about the compression expansions on this question. But one of the great things about these are that they are very permit-light right? It's getting an air permit under a permit by rule arrangement at the TCEQ. We think we can avoid issues that would otherwise trigger a more active Federal review by the core or anyone else. There's some good mitigation built into our plans to avoid endangered species to open water crossings et cetera. So we've got all that worked out. Your bigger question though Nationwide 12 has been open to attack and it's been attacked. There's a process underway right now at the Federal level where a lot of open-ended questions are being asked about should we change this? Should we change that? Should we change the other thing? So there is some uncertainty around Nationwide 12 right now. No doubt about it. Hopefully that uncertainty resolves itself as we get closer to needing to use it for something like a big new greenfield pipeline expansion but we are to be safe evaluating in other context with smaller projects where we may be using Nationwide 12 evaluating how we could get individual permits if need be. Now for the most part what the core will point you toward is Nationwide 12. That's what it's there for use that. But if we were -- it's only prudent for us to evaluate if you end up in a problem there to have a plan B. And so we're developing those plan Bs.,0.002640277,0.002996981,0.000356704
218,218,CTSH,Humphries:,Yes. I'll start and Jan why don't you jump in if needed. Ashwin I think first of all pricing is extremely topical at this moment time given the services companies are knowledge-based organizations and therefore our supply chain for wanted a better word is our talent. And as costs of our people go up by definition we have an obligation to in one form or another either automate change the pyramid change the offshoring mix or near-shoring mix and/or find a way to pass on cost to clients notwithstanding automation agendas or whatnot. So I think at this stage pricing is mainstream in terms of dialogue amongst not just Cognizant but also our peers in the industry to try to offset the compensation pressure. So the classic situation that we have grown up with historically around MSAs being signed with rate cards associated with those and rate cards coming up for renewal every 1 or 2 years that is not necessarily as relevant anymore because people have to intersect those natural cycles. Now on top of that I'd just point out that well as Jan said we have a pricing initiative underway. Clearly the business model evolution of Cognizant which has been quite intentional in recent years including a much greater shift towards digital and the commitment to try to evolve from being a provider of resources to be a solution provider that enables clients to address their pain points by a selling solutioning and delivering client outcomes that puts us in a position where we are competing with sometimes very different competitors and we may have some margin opportunity via pricing leverage as well. So both of those factors I think are pertinent at this moment in time.Rod it's Brian. So first of all we're delighted. We've reduced voluntary attrition for 2 quarters in a row. This quarter attrition fell 5 points sequentially on a voluntary basis and we are extremely comprehensive in our disclosure of attrition perhaps the purest in the industry. That being said I actually anticipate attrition will pick up in the second quarter. In fact I know attrition will pick up because we look at resignations on a daily basis and we anticipate it will be elevated for the course of the year. We have done a tremendous amount in the last year. We call this early. We substantially overspent our allocated budget last year for compensation and promotions because we wanted to invest in our talent try to mitigate attrition and make sure we capture the market opportunity. But this is above and beyond simply financial measures. It's total rewards vacation policy 401(k) policy stock purchase price policy et cetera within total awards. And on top of that then there's a significant amount that we've been doing around investing in our employees whether that is skilling or indeed enabling career path advancements Cognizant as you know very well has always been a company that invested heavily in our people attracted smart people put them into accounts and really enable ourselves to ingratiate ourselves at accounts. Well we've furthered that in the last year by doing what I would view as clever things with regards to our promotion process really trying to make this a little bit more self-service and constant through the course of the year by tying it much greater to skilling as opposed to longevity of tenure and making sure that we try to correlate that with bill rate increases as well. And then there's a broader notion of us getting back on the front foot growing double digits which creates career path opportunities for people and upward mobility and just a celebratory sense of winning bigger deals winning in digital and delivering with success. Now all of that comes against the backdrop of us also in the course of the last few years taking some pain by really balancing our visa dependency in North America given the regulatory backdrop as well. But the heavy lifting of that is now essentially behind us. So we've been working very hard to mitigate attrition. But the reality is the market is red hot behind certain skills and try as we might and we track the data when we promote people or when we give them salary increases. We know how long it mitigate attrition before it picks up again. So I just think this industry is perhaps at a different curve than it was in the last 15 to 20 years perhaps the return to office are much more of a hybrid work will help mitigate what we've seen in the last year but I'm still somewhat pessimistic about the industry attrition trends.Yes. Well the holy grail of course in a services company is somehow to decouple headcount growth and revenue growth but there are multiple factors at play including accelerators and the mix of their headcount onshore versus offshore and indeed within the pyramid. Clearly if I start with the pyramid at the bottom of the pyramid I felt 3 years ago we were light. We hadn't been as aggressive on campus hiring et cetera. And in the last few years we have really I would say materially changed our hiring practices 17 000 a few years ago 33 000 freshers onboarded and infused in the last year. And then we're aiming for 45 0 50 000 this coming year. And I'm assuming that will continue to grow. So that by definition adds headcount at lower levels from a billing perspective. And clearly as you go through rightsize that then you bring people on board you get them trained for a few months you infuse them into accounts and ultimately get them into more billable type roles. So that's been 1 factor where you've seen us materially add headcount. And I think it's fundamentally so core to our success in the years ahead because with those people being skilled and with this internal job moves program that creates upward mobility in our organization we are therefore able to promote from within more often particularly when we have fixed bid or managed services type deals versus a more traditional deal staff augmentation or interview-based role. The second factor I'd say is our mix has shifted like many in the industry about 2 points towards offshore in the last year and that has different dynamics in terms of average bill rate per employee or margin dollars per employee but also margin rate per employee can be higher in offshore. But the attrition that we're experiencing I think as an industry and within Cognizant is broad-based. It's not just in India it's not just in the junior levels of the organization. It's also across Western Europe and North America. So we are continuing to complement the programs we put in place with incremental campus programs in North America nearshore programs in Mexico and Canada which are ramping nicely for us and of course the need for subcontractors and laterals. Subcontractors actually fell sequentially in mid-single digits and that's something we'd obviously like to continue to optimize in the years ahead by getting more campus programs more upward mobility and better demand visibility such that we can avoid as much subcontractors. And then last but not least one of our core competencies I would argue has been our talent acquisition group we've done remarkable work in the last year or so. Certainly the offer to join a ratio has eroded in the industry and Cognizant is no different. But nonetheless we have an incredible capability to bring in tens of thousands of employees per quarter. And I'm firmly of the opinion we're not yet hitting our stride in terms of our revenue potential. So we want to continue to scale our operations to get after the market possibilities that are out there.Yes. Look let's face it. I mean in every C-Suite conversation that I have as I go around the world we all end up talking about multiple things around return to offers hybrid work culture and also about labor and supply chain disruption. And many clients over the years as you know have brought certain skills in-house and they're all dealing with the same trends we are dealing with ourselves in terms of elevated attrition and labor cost increases. So it is quite topical. It's quite known for our client base and we're not the only company in the world approaching clients outside of standard renewal dates to intersect the classic rate card work. It's heavy lifting. It's not easy. I want to call out my team globally. We've worked very hard in the last 9 months to mitigate this to navigate our way through certain icebergs. And we know we've got some heavy lifting ahead of us as well. But the team are committed to do so. And we keep obviously everybody current on a quarter-by-quarter basis and see how much progress we can make in this regard.We just don't know. It's very hard to call Keith. The reality is that attrition slows based on a series of financial measures we've made serious promotion measures we've made. But obviously there are elements of seasonality at play here as bonuses are paid which triggered an increase in attrition in the last few months. And so therefore I know that attrition will go up in Q2 and that's factored into our guidance. Once we get past Q2 we're just going to have to keep a close eye on this and see how we're able to continue to engage employees. I actually believe that the environment we're in these days which I think we've hit a watershed moment of people no longer necessarily wanting to work in an office environment like in the past can be detrimental to employee engagement and cultural affinity and indeed can enable people to work more remotely. And then in countries like India the notion of moving from a large urban center to a rural environment trying to encourage people back to an urban environment can have meaningful consequences for their disposable income at the end of the month. So there's not just a philosophical debate in terms of whether you can commit your work on remotely leveraging technology but it's very much a financial debate as well notwithstanding the broader inflationary pressure in the urban centers or indeed in rural. So I'm somewhat of the opinion that we're at a new norm the labor market as we set. And with that new approach to work industry attrition may pick up on a more sustainable basis particularly in today's demand environment where I still feel that digital transformation is clearly throughout multiple industries and there's a lot more legs on this in the years ahead.,0.004737043,0.012816548,0.004044926
219,219,BK,Portney:,Yes. We are â€“ weâ€™ve obviously shortened duration across the portfolio. Weâ€™ve swapped fixed floating. And considering just the uncertain environment weâ€™re also continuing to be cautious and nimble.Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we still intend to return 100% of our earnings to our shareholders over time and thatâ€™s of course across dividends and buybacks. Weâ€™ve been cautious and I think itâ€™s been appropriate to be somewhat defensive in this environment with the uncertainty and of course the reduction in AOCI. But given the assumptions in our forecast we feel pretty confident that we would expect to return at least 75% of our earnings to our shareholders over this year. And the nice thing about SCB and the SCB framework is that we can be nimble we can be flexible. And ultimately depending upon the runoff we see we might be able to do more.So from a beta perspective as I said before we just expect betas to largely retrace what weâ€™ve seen historically. It does mean youâ€™ll get to the end state faster. In the first rate rise itâ€™s generally and what weâ€™ve experienced is very much as weâ€™ve been expecting in line with expectations kind of betas of 35% to 40%. By the time we kind of get towards year-end and we have many more rate hikes that will be probably closer to â€“ betas would be closer to 70% plus which is kind of where we ended in the last rate cycle. In terms of â€“ what was your last â€“ sorry I missed the question.Yes. It was helpful this quarter. I donâ€™t have it right off hand. But it was obviously â€“ definitely helpful this quarter but â€“ and we just expect it with rates rising as we go forward it will continue to be a bit helpful but frankly at a more modest level.Itâ€™s definitely not so much on â€“ at all on the mandate side. We still â€“ fundamentally our businesses are in really good health. The growth is really just considering the more challenging environment that we are in. And specifically when you look at market levels or client activity across some businesses have slowed down you are seeing or we are expecting a bit more risk-off behavior. And so the particular businesses which are probably most â€“ which are going to be most impacted we think are investment management corporate trust depository receipts to a lot lesser extent asset servicing. And so thatâ€™s whatâ€™s all baked into the 1%-plus guide. But the fundamentals are very good and we feel pretty good about that considering the challenging environment.We donâ€™t disclose that in â€“ we only disclose that concrete item.So what I would say is look we are very focused on driving positive operating leverage. And I just would remind you that overall for â€“ if you look at total revenues we will be â€“ our plan is to deliver positive operating leverage this year. And frankly thatâ€™s with the impact of the Russian notable items. So I think thatâ€™s pretty good. In terms of fee â€“ when we think about just fee revenue versus expenses what I would say is that when you look at our â€“ the guide that we gave for the rest of the year it does â€“ our expense guide does include slightly more inflationary pressures as well as the investments of course that we have talked about extensively that we think are very compelling and some will pay off sooner and some will pay off a bit over the course of the next couple of years. And as we talked about itâ€™s way too early to kind of talk about like what itâ€™s going to look like in say 24 months 36 months out. But we have said that ultimately over time we would expect expense growth the rate of growth to moderate.Sure. Go ahead.Yes. We really decided a few more of a full year guide for the second quarter. But I mean to size what you are thinking about I think specifically on waivers we do see the Fed raise rates by 50 basis in May as I think we are all kind of expecting. Obviously that will be a nice uptick in terms of recouping waivers and itâ€™s to the tune of call it like $100 million or so is what I â€“ is how I would estimate it.So I will take a couple of parts to that and Todd or Robin might want to chime in about the inorganic opportunities. But in terms of organic growth I mean just remember when we define organic growth we are normalizing for market appreciation or depreciation but it is fair that risk-on or risk-off behavior associated with that could also impact organic growth. And so what I would say is itâ€™s hard we donâ€™t really say like whatâ€™s the sensitivity. But yes there certainly could be more upside if you see more risk on behavior and ultimately that means more trading more transaction volume etcetera. So that is upside. So itâ€™s certainly not out of the realm of possibility that it could be higher. In terms of â€“ what was your secondâ€¦Sure. Yes. We have disclosed this. I think you can find in the K. So basically any like a 5% move in equity markets is kind of happening gradually throughout the year is about an additional $75 million in revenue.Todd do you want me to take inorganic or you want to?Sure. I mean on inorganic what I would say and Todd and I have been very consistent on this is that we are â€“ of course we always are evaluating inorganic opportunities. But at the same time the bar is really really high. And itâ€™s not high just from a return perspective itâ€™s also very high from an execution risk perspective. So we have been doing several deals but they have been mostly kind of digestible bolt-on things that are adding capabilities or markets or clients. And we will continue to look out for those.So actually we have been â€“ we are very proactively growing the loan portfolio. So yes as you mentioned itâ€™s up 3% on average and 18% year-on-year. We will continue â€“ itâ€™s our expectation to continue to grow that over the course of this year. And where we are seeing it is really on a couple of different areas. So capital call facilities certainly trade finance likewise margin loans CCLs and mortgages and well so let pretty much across the board. And thatâ€™s â€“ we want to be there and leverage our balance sheet for our clients when it make sense.I am not going to really comment on kind of how itâ€™s going to be paced throughout the year. I think you can kind of look at all of our ratios and make your own assumptions. But â€“ and the thing I would just remind everyone again is that the SCB framework is really allows us to be very nimble and very flexible.Itâ€™s â€“ we donâ€™t â€“ we will obviously be updating that when we release the Q. What I would say is we are much more sensitive of course to short-term rates and long-term rates. That continues of course to be the case. And you will see more of that when we actually release the Q.So in terms of Tier 1 leverage we have always said that given the extraordinary circumstances we are in and all of the excess liquidity in the system that we would be â€“ it makes perfect sense to dip into our buffer to a degree which is what we have done. We would expect of course as we start to see some probably deposit runoffs that will take a lot of pressure off Tier 1 leverage. And what I would also just flag is that by the end of the year itâ€™s not â€“ itâ€™s likely â€“ actually not out of the normal possibility but frankly probably likely that our binding constraint will become CET1 versus Tier 1 leverage. And frankly I think if you are toggling between Tier 1 and turn leverage in CET1 that actually is very good. It means you are managing your balance sheet optimally.There isnâ€™t a limit per se but we obviously do that very with our partners in risk and we are always making sure that whatever we move there is high-quality liquid assets that generally speaking you can repo it. Repo those assets etcetera. So I wouldnâ€™t expect it to increase a lot more from here.,0.002954245,0.003375769,0.000357165
220,220,FIS,Norcross:,Yeah. I think if you look at the first quarter number we're expecting modest growth sequentially from here consistent with Woody's comments.Yeah. Look I think we see a real good opportunity in our merchant segment. We are really good about -- we feel great about our e-commerce our enterprise segment. We feel good about the Payrix acquisition and helping us in the SMB market with card-not-present. Clearly you're seeing mix issues as we come out of the pandemic but we continue to take share in the enterprise and e-commerce. The Nilson ratings substantiate that. So we feel very bullish on the overall merchant business and feel very comfortable with our guide on that not only this year but going into the next several years. So I think we're very well positioned.Yeah. Look I mean Ashwin our view on this hasn't changed. I mean given the current valuations of our stock given the current dislocation of where we think the share price of trade that the best use of cash on a derisked return is buying back our own shares. With that being said we have traditionally done M&A as a company. And so it's been a key component of our strategy. And obviously we want to make sure that we continue to watch what's going on in the market. But right now we feel very good about our competitive position. We feel we're strong across all three of our segments are executing very well. As I said Nilson should substantiate this share loss narrative in Merchant. You see what we're doing in the Banking business. And let's not forget about our capital markets business from that performance which shows the strength of the overall capability and the strength of our go-to-market and the strength of our execution. So right now the best use is certainly deploying that capital through share repurchase. As we get a recovery in our stock price we would certainly look to at some point in time open up our lens again and start thinking about M&A and what are new markets we could possibly break into or new capabilities that we can put through our distribution channel to further accelerate growth from here. But at this point in time we're very comfortable with share repurchase and obviously returning cash to our shareholders through our dividend which we increased 21% as well. And as Woody said in his prepared remarks we're prepared to do that again at the early next year as well. So hopefully that gives you context.Let me start and let's let Woody get to the specific percentage of total revenues at SaaS. I mean I'll remind you on capital markets this was a very detailed transformation that we drove through in our capital markets business. It started at the acquisition of SunGard moving it from a product company to a solution company and then deploying those solutions through a SaaS-based model. When we bought the company it was in the low-60% reoccurring revenue. And most of that recurring revenue was in the form of either a processing fee or in the form of a highly recurring maintenance fee. So we wanted to transition that business and really start deploying capital markets once we built all the solutions and modernize them and put them together through a more SaaS deployment. The team has done an excellent job of that. We've continued to accelerate our SaaS-based recurring sales model. It was up 8% this quarter alone. You've seen that very consistent Ashwin. We've been holding our license fees flat. So what we've been trying to do is we run a little over 300 million license fees a year. We don't want to dig the whole while we're growing through the transformation. This is the exact playbook that we executed in the banking business decades ago. So the customers are very willing to take advantage of our processing environment our SaaS deployment and our modernized solution. And the reason why is because as Stephanie commented when we were at the user conference what you're seeing large financial institutions are realizing processing is no longer a differentiator. Total cost of ownership speed to market resiliency capabilities is where they're going to differentiate. And the capital markets business is very well positioned to take advantage of that. So over the last couple of years we managed to grow that Woody from 60s to --Yeah. I'll remind our investors this is a business that at some point in time we will start discontinuing license fees. So right now we're renewing these term license with existing customers. We're taking on very few new logos through the licensing channel. All of our new logos are coming in through our SaaS-based model which shows the strength of that product and how many actually new customers were also bringing into the mix. But there will be a point where we'll start discontinuing the license model and then that will accelerate it to Woody's point of where it will be upper 80s perhaps even low-90s. And you'll have a very very small percentage of license business going forward.So Dan just kind of to build on that if you think about our enterprise business to move 200 basis points you've got to take a lot of transaction volume to do that. And that's where our enterprise play comes in. We've highlighted over throughout the pandemic strengthen our sales engine in enterprise right and in e-com. And so you're just really seeing not only the large enterprise share gainers right that Stephanie referenced but also our success in coming out of the pandemic reinvigorating our sales engine in enterprise as well. So all of those things are playing a contribution to the 200 basis points. The question around debit and credit in our enterprise play specifically really doesn't have a play. Plus it really doesn't for us. It really doesn't matter. For us we're there to capture transactions. And whether it's presented as a credit or a debit transaction really our fee structures are very resilient in that. So you've got great stickiness in the enterprise because of scale. We have very very low turnover. So clearly what you've seen is just us taking share through the sales engine. Our large existing enterprise customers taking share through their scale and then the resiliency of the revenue stream credit and debit really we're virtually immune to . It's really more transaction-based than volume-based.That's right.Well look James I mean we've been in business for a very long time right? So as you think about it a lot of technologies in financial services are based on historical legacy platforms. We took we pivoted the company back in 2015 to really start focusing on the next-generation capabilities that we're going to need to be -- that you're going to need to compete for the next 20-25 years. And so as you start looking at whether it was in the merchant platform where we invested heavily in the new acquiring platform and access Worldpay we've got that fully online now; whether you look in the banking sector and you look at what we've done around modern banking platform which is the most leading technology for cloud-native core banking system in market. You've seen that with our wins but look at what we did on Payments One which is a cloud native issuer platform for both debit credit prepaid. You then move into our Digital One our omnichannel experience that wraps around those capabilities once again coming fully online in market and then our CodeConnect platform for our micro services layer. You then move into what we did in Capital Markets where we really leaned in our solutioning about bringing our capabilities and launching that in the cloud to leverage both buy-side and sell-side type capital markets capabilities on SaaS deployment that all boils down to we're wrapping up those programs. And so we increased our capital starting back in 2015. We were running at about 5%. And we ramped that up to I think as high as 11% of total revenues. And as those platforms have now come to conclusion you would expect those investments to come down. Now what we've all talked about we'll maintain that around 6% to 7%. We think there's an opportunity to continue to lean in and add functionality and continue to grow and expand our revenue growth and our share. But all programs come to a natural conclusion. And we're just on the back side of the modernization of our solution stack. Now we do have a historical back book that at some point in time we'll start migrating. Stephanie highlighted some of the stuff we're already doing in banking. We've migrated more than 1 500 of our clients to Payments One as an example. But more to come on that as we upsell and migrate our existing customers to those capabilities. But we feel very good about our competitive position. You see all of our segments growing and taking share by various metrics. And so at this point in time we're just -- we're wrapping up a lot of these platform transformations.Yeah. No exactly. Exactly. We feel great about it. Well look I want to thank you for joining us this morning and thank you to our dedicated colleagues for another strong quarter.

221,221,DVN,Muncrief:,Good morning John.Yes. Good question Matt. We talk about this all the time and certainly Devon will always be a company that stays kind of in the know so to speak and with whatâ€™s in the market doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™ll participate but I can assure you weâ€™ll have this some kind of an idea of valuations. From our standpoint nothing really changes. I mean we have â€“ weâ€™ve always had a real high bar of asset purchases or timing even of sales. And nothingâ€™s really going to change our framework. I mean our number one priority is you've heard it weâ€™ve articulated several times today and thatâ€™s returning cash back to shareholders and returning value back to shareholders and really really excited about our outlook. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re so constructive on our share repurchase the program to be honest with you. We just think weâ€™re fundamentally undervalued. And so once again that makes potential acquisitions more challenging because it fundamentally just has to be very accretive to us and we have to feel that it makes sense. And so nothingâ€™s really changed from what youâ€™ve seen over last several years really.Yes. Thatâ€™s a good question. And itâ€™s always something we could do Matt but I can tell you the Dow JV is really a nice setup for us. You mentioned the NGL exposure that is tremendous here in the Anadarko and Clay talks about how the team is getting more and more confident in those returns and certainly on a promoted basis theyâ€™re absolutely phenomenal. Theyâ€™re just really really strong. When you start thinking about JVs and other areas where we have exposure to gas I mean the first place we have most exposure to gas would be the Permian. Really. I donâ€™t know that we have a strong appetite to do a lot of gas JVs down there right now. It just doesnâ€™t seem like that makes a lot of sense for us. I think weâ€™re going to continue to focus on developing the high liquids where youâ€™re 50% 60% crude oil plus the NGL thatâ€™s where youâ€™re going to get some real margins in juice your returns. So I think for us right now we got a great set up. I donâ€™t see us really having a strong appetite with these kind of commodity prices to move into another gassy base and set up some type of a JV there. I donâ€™t think that makes sense. So I think weâ€™ll just really stick with what we have right now makes probably the most sense for us.Hi Doug.I think just fundamentally all the questions I think some investors grapple with it and quite honestly weâ€™ve debated over the last 12 15 months is it either or we felt like most of the investors we felt like were giving us very very candid feedback. They preferred that return of cash today rather than share repurchase. As weâ€™ve gotten into it Doug I can tell you that weâ€™ve become more and more convicted. We continue to debate this with internally here and with our Board. And we just feel fundamentally that the curve is heavily backwardated but itâ€™s been wrong. And thatâ€™s why you continue to see it come up. And this is not just the Ukraine the horrible situation Ukraine driving. It certainly is we all know that itâ€™s a factor but we have become more and more convicted that share repurchases make a lot of sense for us. And â€“ but itâ€™s not just an either or itâ€™s â€“ weâ€™re going to do both. And matter of fact weâ€™re not just doing both weâ€™re doing the third thing and thatâ€™s aggressively paying down debt. So all of this creates value to our shareholders. It makes the equity I think more more valuable. And you start looking at the disciplined weâ€™re employing. When I look at the equity performance yes itâ€™s been great what we have done over the last 12 months. Weâ€™re excited about that. But I still think that at the end of the day the story has just begun with energy. And I think we continue to get â€“ thatâ€™s what makes a market right? You have people that push back on thesis and people that push back on perspectives but ours was that if we it goes all the way back to the fundamentals of the merger that we announced 18 months ago. We felt like that it would make a lot of sense. We give us a lot of lot of runway to implement a variable dividend which we both companies were very big fans of. But we were able to accelerate that. And as things that we saw the synergies we saw the opportunity to set up for the continued execution managing through these supply chains. And thatâ€™s why we just feel that fundamentally our equity is undervalued and thatâ€™s â€“ that gives us the conviction to go out and buy it back. And so weâ€™re going to have a multi-prong attack and I think thatâ€™s the best thing we can do as a management team I believe.Thanks. Thank you Doug. Take care. Talk soon.Hi Charles.Clay you want to answer that?Yes Iâ€™ll rewind back just a little bit as we talk about weather I really didnâ€™t get to talk about it earlier. But in the first quarter we had four weather events blow through the teams getting better and better overall. This was probably more Mid-Con and Permian related that manifested during the course of the first quarter to respond to that to mitigate make sure weâ€™re avoiding any safety events incidents environmental incidents protecting the wells and then getting them back on. And that was all baked into the first quarter results. We did have some downtime associated with that. As you mentioned in the second quarter namely in the month of April we had some fairly late spring massive snow events mainly in Williston but it also hit a little bit into Wyoming our Powder as well. We had the ranges Iâ€™ve heard from the field were 26 to 40 inches of snow over the course of just a couple of days. We had people completely snowed in to their house not even able to get to the field to check on wells. The good news is with our modern operations weâ€™re able to remotely monitor wells but you can only do that to a certain degree. We can remote shut in wells. We have cameras on location so you can visually see if anythingâ€™s going on except if the whole fieldâ€™s covered in feet of snow. Then itâ€™s hard to see even whatâ€™s going on. So we did have some downtime very significant. We had a â€“ the weather event I mentioned and then the next weekend we had to follow on another six inches of snow followed with some rain in Williston a larger snow event in Wyoming. And I can tell you the teams did a great job no safety incidents to speak of no significant environmental events to mention. We did have a production impact. And as you mentioned it was â€“ itâ€™s all baked in. The 80% I think thatâ€™s way overstated for our operations. I donâ€™t know what the source of that information was but we baked our production forecast in and accounting for all of this weather. And just great work by the team in our field. I mean I canâ€™t say enough about how great these guys are.,0.002535462,0.002609313,8.94E-05
222,222,KKR,Larson:,Thanks Bill. It's Craig. Why don't I start on deployment and then Rob will give the modernization update and look deployment is a meaty question. So you have inflation interest rates outlook for economic growth all being front of mind for us as they have in for some time. And alongside of that we expect a number of rate hikes this year with central banks tricking their balance sheet. So against these topics we're expecting more volatility. So what are the implications of this? If you one as a firm we need to be as connected as ever and we need to continue to be thematic. So in terms of areas of focus for us a couple of thoughts. One you've already heard this from what Rob and Scott said earlier but get long pricing power. So with labor shortages higher input costs we think companies with pricing power our advantage. Number two own more collateral-based cash flows. So we believe real assets investments that can keep up with nominal GDP are interesting. So that's infrastructure real estate asset based finance and you heard us again in the prepared remarks. When you look at private when we're asked about deployment it often tends to be with a private equity lens for us. So if you look in both last year and as well as in the first quarter private equity deployment as a percentage of our firm has been a teen's percentage. And so as the breadth of the firm's increased you've seen these real assets become materially greater for us in terms of deployment. So when you look at real assets in terms of private markets deployment real assets we're 55% of private markets deployment in 2021 67% of deployment in the first quarter of this year. Three digitization automation logistics we're in the midst of an innovation boom in disruption and technological change from our standpoint spins continue. Four security including energy security data payment cyber all areas and these are areas where we think we bring a unique lens in a lot of industry expertise. And then five we're in many ways a savings bull market. And in Asia you have a billion millennials who want to build a safety net through increased savings for the families. So that means themes like nesting retirement products financial planning all should benefit. And I think the other point in this again I would just touch on relates to culture and this I'd reinforce something that Scott had touched on but we have a culture that's wonderfully connected and our view and dislocation occurs that some solutions for companies become less apparent and that's when you get a real sense for culture and acumen and we think we have a culture that really allows us to stay wonderfully connected and allows us to be on our front foot in these periods.Yeah. Craig on China a couple of thoughts. One I think look China investing in China has become more complex and so we think it's critical to have the right resources in order to navigate the complexity. So we think it's -- you need a best in class local team but you need more. We think it's important to have specialized resources like our public affairs team like our global Institute to help navigate that complexity. So we think China is going to continue to be a critical long term engine of global growth. So it's a very important market no question. And we think we bring unique skills and a differentiated approach to that market. Now I think when you look at where we've been investing a lot of it has been behind themes like domestic consumption. So we remain committed to being a leading investor domestically in China. And we want to help leading local firms to continue to grow and prosper and we think we're well positioned and to give you a sense just a significance overall as a firm when you look at our exposure it does remain quite modest just given the breadth of our firm today. So investments in China from an AUM standpoint are probably a little over 1% of our AUM just to give you a sense of scaleYeah. The only thing I would add Brian is I think the point we're trying to get across as well we'll continue to remain active looking at inorganic opportunities and that's something we'll keep you updated on but if you just look back I think what we're trying to say is that the balance sheet has allowed us to pursue those with minimal equity issuance while also buying back 10% of our outstanding shares since 2015. And if you think about it Marshall Waste Franklin Square Global Atlantic what we talked about with core not the J-REIT that's over $200 billion of AUM that was bought with minimal equity dilution and using the balance sheet as that strategic weapon. And a lot of the things that we've done that I listed have been done during periods of time where there's some dislocation or some volatility.Thank you.Yeah Rufus. Thanks for the question. I think the first thing to consider as you think about our balance sheet strategy is that it's very much an aligned strategy. KKR employees are the largest group of shareholders in the firm on an almost 30% of KKR. So we start from a very aligned perspective and as we sit here today we see more opportunities to leverage the broader platform and ecosystem of KKR to drive ROE with that capital inside of KKR. And so long as that continues and we're able to drive additional ROE on that capital base for the benefit of all shareholders then you're going to see a consistency strategy. To the extent that that changes over time where we're not seeing that attractive level of return then obviously we might have a different strategy but certainly as we sit here today we are highly convicted in the way that we're operating the opportunities we see and the long-term accretion that we're able to create for all shareholders by virtue of the capital base that we have.Sure. Chris great question. Why don't I start it's Craig. So look at a high level we're committed to investing in the energy transition and the shift to clean energy. So reflecting this we invest in a diverse range of energy sources. So let's touch first on renewables. So think global clean energy developers and operators we've been increasingly active in this space and you've seen that across really a number of strategies including areas for us like infrastructure well as our impact business. Now alongside of that is conventional energy interactivity here is really being done through a permanent capital vehicle that we own a teen's percentage of that's called Crescent Energy. And we think Crescent can become a real leader in developing best in class ESG programs in addition to creating significant equity value. We receive management fees that increase over time as Crescent scales its business. It can send a fee eligible based on the total return of the equity and from a business standpoint Crescent has low leverage. It's free cash flow positive has an excellent team in place. And it is operating in an area that we think there's real M&A opportunities. So that's our overall approach. Hopefully that gives you a better sense.I think it and maybe this is a -- this gets perhaps into a little bit of a history lesson around Crescent honestly Chris. So in 2020 we traded in an entity that was called Independence Energy and through that we had combined our energy income and growth fund some energy investments from the balance sheet co-investment assets and those were contributed together with investments from an insurance client and that formed Independence Energy. And then what you saw five or six months ago it was in December of 2021 was we merged that entity with a public ENT company to form Crescent. So Crescent is a $2.6 billion market cap company. Again we own a teens percentage but what really Crescent is is the next step and it's the next evolution of those dedicated of funds for us. So that's really the -- that's how our views and our focus is really we expect will be through Crescent.Thank you.So Finian again we actually feel great about the progress we've made. Rome wasn't built in a day and how we're positioned against this opportunity. Nothing to announce right at the moment as it relates to incremental products. But again over time we expect to have democratized products across all of our asset classes and we're investing in all of the areas that we think it takes to be successful in this channel. Reflecting that point of view we've said a couple of quarters ago that we think new capital raised from individuals is going to be a third to half of new capital race for us as a firm in the medium term and no change in that outlook or point of view for us. It's just a really exciting opportunity that when we look at our brand our long term track record the ability that we have to innovate and product design and the relationships we have we just think we're really position against this enormous market.Yeah. Hey Rob. It is certainly a sector we continue to look at. It is not a need to do type of acquisition for us. But if we find a platform that we've got conviction can be a top three player that we can help make them better they can help make us better and valuation makes sense. It certainly could be something that we could pursue in the future and so yeah we've got as I mentioned earlier we've got a team that looks across different inorganic opportunities of the firm as we line up different potential sub-sectors of the asset management space. Clearly the addressable market and the secondary space is quite large. But from our perspective it's got to work for us. And it's got to be something that we've got a lot of conviction is going to fit in well within our firm which in part is going to require it to be a top three player. And so we'll continue to keep you updated of course on our progress and our thinking but that's where we are right now.Thank you. Our pleasure. ThanksThank you our everybody for your time and patience this morning and your interest in KKR. We look forward to following up with many of you directly and if not we look forward to giving you our next update in 90 days or so. Thanks again.,0.005130172,0.009662628,0.002899837
223,223,ILMN,deSouza:,All right. So let me take the questions one at a time. So Chemistry X will continue to give you technical updates as they become available. And the economics update will really depend on the instrument that we put Chemistry X into because it will be different because ultimately the economics of an instrument depend on the new chemistry but also every other part of the instrument right? The optics that we put in there the flow cells that you put in there the compute infrastructure. And so Chemistry X will be definitely a heavy contributor to superior economics in an instrument but to tell you the overall economics we'd have to lay out the entire configuration of an instrument and then we'll share with you what that instrument would give you. I can tell you right now that frankly 20% to 25% would be low. If you think about the road map of the new Chemistry right? If you look at look at what we got with the last generation of Chemistry right? So when Solexa came out in 2007 the project we got from them is $150 000 to launch -- to do a genome. Today it's less than 600 right? So that chemistry if you look at the lifetime of that chemistry. Now I don't want to give all the credit just to the chemistry because obviously there were innovations again in optics and data paths and compute and everything associated with that. But very very significant road map in terms of price reductions that were enabled. So this is the most significant update we've done in Chemistry since the original SBS was invented. And so you should think about the lifetime of this Chemistry is giving us a lot of headroom in terms of performance but also in terms of price reduction. So I would be personally disappointed if over the lifetime of this Chemistry you were just thinking about a 20% to 25% reduction. Secondly let's talk about GRAIL. So the grow revenue for the year what we said and reaffirm is that the majority of the GRAIL revenue for this year will come from testing. There will be a component that comes from their pharma partnerships but it won't be the majority of their revenue. And that's what they're working towards on the plan they're on.So thanks for that question. Let me start with the first one which is -- we have always had to compete in the high throughput environment and we expect to continue to. And I'll start by saying that the genomics market as a whole as I said earlier is a large and growing market that's in the early stages of penetration. And so we expect there will be vendors to emerge there'll be vendors that -- some that go away. But we expect that there will be competition in that space and that's what we've built into our plans. Having said that I'm also very confident in our competitive posture in that market today and extraordinarily excited by the road map that we have in terms of enhancing that competitive posture. And I'll start again what I said a little bit earlier which is when you think about even just the cost element it's really important that you think about the total cost of ownership especially on the high throughput side. When you're generating so much data the compute costs the storage costs the end-to-end workflow costs all of that become very important. And so when you look at the levers of innovation that we have not just to continue to drive the performance and price points associated with the core sequencing. But the levers we have around the end-to-end workflow we have a terrific ability to offer a very strong value proposition in that high throughput market. And then the second question is on cost cutting.Yes Puneet. There's a lot that can open up as we continue to drive the price of sequencing down because the reality today is that we're still at the very early stages of understanding how a genome translates into human health and human disease. We've unlocked the first clinical applications. NIPT cancer therapy selection. There are many many many many more that we know will emerge once we're able to do the experiments of the size that we need to do. For example if you look at complex diseases like neurological conditions whether it's autism or schizophrenia or Alzheimer's or Parkinson's what we're hearing from the research community is that if you look at schizophrenia for example in families it's clear that there is a genomic component to it but there's complex causality there. And the only way you can unravel the biology is by running cohorts that are not measured in the thousands or even tens of thousands but are much bigger than that. And so there's a huge amount of promise to uncover and address some of the genomic underpinnings of neurological conditions. We need cohorts much much bigger than we've seen historically. And that's -- those are the kinds of experiments. Similarly when you think about what we need to understand about single cells and the heterogeneity of expression across the cells across the human body there are tens of trillions of cells in the body. So if you want to do even just a representative -- statistically representative experiment you don't need just thousands of cells like people are doing today. You need sizes in the millions or tens of millions and we need to understand that. And so those are the kinds of experiments that we're getting pushed on and say okay if you can just keep driving the prices down it just opens up the large research areas which then will translate into a future area of new diagnostics new screening modalities as well as new therapeutics. And so that's -- those are the kinds of big big markets that get opened up. Today if you look at the top 10 causes of death for mankind genomics helps address cancer one of those top 10. The reality is that if you play this out a decade maybe longer genomics is going to help us address all 10. But to really understand the biology we need an enormous amount of research to be done. And then we need an entire new set of diagnostic screens and therapeutics. And so that's what gets enabled.Yes. The -- we are seeing real strength across the board in the clinical market. So if you look across regions we're seeing a huge amount of strength obviously in Americas and so on. But even in China where we talked about the COVID restrictions we still had strong momentum in the clinical market and signed up as Sam pointed out 38 new hospitals as well. So what's driving that? One of the biggest drivers of that is oncology testing for therapy selection. The coverage that's been put in place for that the move from smaller panels to comprehensive genomic profiling that requires larger panels. Now people looking at clinical exomes that's driving a huge amount of strength. And if you look at a number of our metrics whether it's the consumables that are being pulled into that market or even the NovaSeq we saw for example I think it was about 40% of our NovaSeqs that were shipped in Q1 went to oncology testing customers. And so I'd start by saying that oncology testing for therapy selection is a juggernaut that drove a lot of our growth in the clinical markets last year. It's continuing to play out this year because a lot of the -- a lot of the underlying demand drivers are still strong. We also saw though strong demand in genetic disease testing and that had another strong quarter in Q1. And some of the similar dynamics are playing out there. The dramatic expansion in coverage over the last couple of years is really helping fuel that demand. In addition that -- those applications are sequencing intensive applications. So you're talking about clinical genome you're talking about trios where those are available. And so that is continuing to fuel some of the demand in the clinical markets that we are seeing. And that has a lot of headroom in front of it in both of those markets. The clinical market actually is a one market is a market where I think we have a special strength right? Because we have established over the last decade a number of things that customers really like. So for example we have cleared boxes both the MiSeqDx which got clearance in 2013 but also now we have the NextSeqDx that's available to customers and we are marching down the path to deliver a NovaSeqDx. That puts us in a unique position at this point is that if you want to develop on a cleared box we are a really great choice for you. In addition we have some end-to-end workflows that are really exciting to our customers. TSO 500 is a fantastic product. And we talked about the fact that if you look at Q1 TSO 500 had really really strong growth growing over 100% from the previous year Q1. And then we're also continuing to see demand for our VeriSeq NIPT end-to-end workflow. So again that positions us especially well against anyone else who's looking for -- in terms of customers looking for cleared workflows that they can buy and use. And then even customers that are running in LDT mode they have spent a long time developing their own validated workflows on our instruments even if they're using our non-DX instruments but it's taken them a long time to build up their validated workflows and to bring those to scale. And so from their perspective it's a better thing in terms of running their labs to just continue to expand the relationship with Illumina. And so those are some of the dynamics in that space.Yeah sure. Outside of the things you talked about we are seeing adoption from groups like employers. And it was really -- it's unexpected and it's exciting to see the range of industries where employers are signing up. The thesis that said you expect some of the early adopter industries like maybe tech maybe financial services where they are -- they tend to be earlier adopters of benefit. So you expected to see some of those employers. But the range of industries represented was an upside surprise. So for example logistics and transport companies media companies it's a broader list than you would expect and that continued in Q1 as well. They're also signing up beyond concierge systems. They're signing up health systems that like Point32Health that we pointed out life insurance companies like Munich Re. And then there's certainly a retail element to what they're getting to and off their website through their partnership with Genomic Health. And that continues to grow as well. And that's also driving the -- their interest in wanting to continue to expand their profile in front of consumers. And so you should expect them to see more in terms of getting the GRAIL brand and the Galleri brand in front of consumers. They're also expanding their reach directly to oncologists and we talked about the fact that they're expanding their staff. A part of that was expanding their commercial staff their sales staff that actually calls on doctors. And so that will continue to expand demand both in terms of bringing new prescribing doctors into the fold but also continuing to expand the number of tests that a prescribing doctor orders.Sure. The GRAIL team continues to make progress in their MRD. We are excited about what that would bring to the market using their sort of hypothesis-free tumor-naive approach into the market. We think that's a valuable assay for customers and allows them to get tested more quickly than an approach that requires a tissue sample for example. So we think it will be a valuable add into the market. At this point we don't have any additional updates other than the team is continuing to work on it and making progress. But as soon as we have some we will make sure to share it. The initial reaction from customers on Chemistry X has been very positive just building excitement around what it could do. Obviously at this point it's not tied to a specific instrument and sort of curiosity around when and through what form factor they'll get access to Chemistry X but there's general enthusiasm around the promise of the new era of chemistry for SBS. And they've all seen what SBS has done over the last 17 years. And so a huge amount of enthusiasm for the next leg of this journey. Sorry that I will say though having said all that it hasn't really muted as you've seen the demand for our existing instrument the NextSeq 1000 2000 the NovaSeqs we continue to see really strong demand for those instruments. And that's because our customers know we have a history of looking after our customers as we launch new products right by providing them very robust upgrade paths and looking at what they've ordered in the backlog and making sure they are happy about how we can move orders to new instruments if that's what they choose. And so we've established I think a good track record of carrying people through an upgrade process and whether it's trade in policies. And so that track record over the last decade I think is helping in terms of customers feeling confident about moving forward with instruments knowing that to the extent that we launch an instrument that upgrades any part of our portfolio we will have very robust upgrade programs for them.Yes. So let's go through all three. I'll start by talking about the NCI commentary? And frankly just the idea that look ultimately you do want to see the impact on survival rates. And so that's going to be important and that's something we're going to be tracking over the next few years. Obviously it will take a long time to get that kind of data. But we will get it of course. Now having said that we do know that survival rates for cancer are very different depending on the stage you catch cancers. But even for a deadly cancer like a pancreatic cancer survival rates are higher if you catch the pancreatic cancer early versus catching a cancer late. And the disease burden of cancer is so high. 10 million people a year die of cancer 600 000 in the US here alone. And because the fact that you have a higher survival rate when you catch it early we know that 71% of the people who die from cancer die from cancers that have no screens because you can't catch those type of cancers early. And so those are -- that the facts the facts that we know that are fueling doctors to prescribe this test to their patients. And now they're up to 2 400 doctors that prescribe -- remember that this test was only launched in June. So we went from zero doctors a year ago to now 2 400 doctors that are confident and comfortable prescribing this test to their patients. And so I think that's going to continue to build. And while it's continuing to build we'll continue to build the data set to ultimately track this to survival rates. And so you'll get that data eventually. But in the meantime we believe a lot of lives will be saved on the way. The team has continued to make progress in terms of engaging with the FDA. There is no new time lines to be announced. I don't think the size of the study is going to be the problem and it'll just take time. I think they've powered the studies they need sufficiently and the dialogue has been constructive with the FDA.,0.002772084,0.003102303,0.000178118
224,224,DD,Breen:,Yes I would say 2 things Steve. Our portfolio we feel very good about. And it's a fairly broad portfolio so we touch most of the water filtration type markets out there wastewater home home applications which are big for us in China desalination as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So we feel good about the breadth of what we have in the technology we have behind it and we continue to bring new products out to market. The one area that we would look at and by that it doesn't mean it's an acquisition that could be organically done as we need to expand our manufacturing footprint and we need a bigger presence with the manufacturing in the Asia market which is a very fast-growing market for us. So we've been studying very hard a project there to bring up a facility in the next couple of years in that area. So that's a high priority for us. And then this kind of goes to the second part of your question there the one opportunity we have or potentially have and our R&D team and application teams are looking at is digitizing the water business. So we know when replacement components are needed ahead of time and it's kind of systematized and that could be a real opportunity for us to kind of satisfy our customers by doing it that way. And that opportunity we've been studying hard for the last year.Yes. Nothing new has changed on the landscape except I'll just say we continue to be in conversations with the plaintiffs down in the MDL. I feel like we will make progress this year on that. By the way the judge has continued to encourage us the judge down there in charge of these MDL cases has actually encouraged us and the plaintiffs we talk in and coming up with a settlement. And so I'll just leave it at that for now but nothing new besides that.They have the backlog. A lot of it is in the EV space. We've looked at it. So it's just a matter of A getting over the lockdown issue in China and then actually accomplishing the ramp in their production rates. But we think second half of the year they'll be right around the ZIP code of where we would expect it.Yes. So Delrin by the way we've been putting the data room together and all that. We're just getting ready to launch on that and we would expect that Delrin will take about a year just like the other part of M&M to actually close the deal. So we'll get a deal done in a 4- 5-month window and then regulatory approvals that will kind of take like a year. So data room is getting finished up. And obviously we've had inbound phone calls about it but we haven't really gone into deep engagement yet. We're just getting ready to do that kind of in the next couple of weeks.No I am not going to do that. We sold 90% of that at 14.1x. So I think what we said more than happened. And I will say Delrin is a very good business. It's a very high EBITDA business so we're looking forward to a nice sale there.I think what would occur is hopefully commodity prices come down and we hold obviously some of the price because of the products that we have. I would think thatâ€™s the more rational way things could play out here. And you're not incorrect. This business can run at like 28% EBITDA margin. So we're certainly not pleased at 26% but 26% we don't feel bad about in this environment but we would certainly strive to be more in that 28% range and we have been there before. So as Lori said part of it you'll just get by. If you just take all of this price cost out for a second because it's not normal times we'll get a couple of points of pricing every year with our new product introductions. We don't get paid like you do in electronics and we truly can get incremental net pricing in the business which will help. But our biggest opportunity as we highlighted in the past is continue to get capacity released from these bigger assets like Tyvek and Nomex. We got a lot of programs around that. And that will drive the throughput through those facilities which really has an impact on the numbers. So we do think this business should run a couple of hundred basis points higher we can get there.Yes. Rogers will not run around $200 million in the second half of the year. They have -- the demand is there. We know the book by the way again muted pretty significantly by COVID China. And don't forget it's auto related a lot of the business. So that's not being as hot as it should even though end market demand is there. But they'll be running at a much more significant rate in the third quarter assuming again the COVID stuff is all cleaned up lockdowns have ended and we have line of sight where we're allowed to talk about synergy work on the cost side of 115 million. We're highly confident in it on a percentage basis with the combo of that coming in with our life business it's not a percent that's on the high end at all. So like Laird with 60 we now have line of sight detail. I detail the 63 in this one. We have -- we're really racking and stacking where we have a lot of it identified. So we'll get at it really quick. And remember one of the things that will happen immediately on the Rogers synergies is there's corporate expense of some significance because it's a public company. And that will be cleaned up very very quickly and then we'll start on the rest of the synergies. So -- but it will run at a very different rate in the second half of the year.Yes I think that's fair. With synergies then you got them kicking in we'll hopefully move fast on that.No. I don't at all. There's nothing in the portfolio actually -- 95% of the portfolio is cutting-edge technology. If you haven't had the chance we did all the [keychins] recently on the electronics business. I think we're in a very strong technology position and we're constantly innovating. It's a fast-paced innovation in electronics both weâ€™re innovating literally monthly coming out with new products in the marketplace. We're always on the cutting edge. So I don't see that. I think what you were mentioning was Solamet paste was just more of a commoditized business that was current -- but that's not where the portfolio is headed and certainly not in addition to the acquisitions with Laird and Rogers. They're very key positions we have in great technology plays.Yes. No we've been as we've mentioned before we've been talking about settlement with the plaintiffs and mostly obviously around the water cases. And as I have mentioned a few minutes ago the judge has even encouraged both parties to be talking to each other I think that was made public I don't know a month or 6 weeks ago. So hopefully good progress this year.I would just give you one other angle obviously we look at very hard. And you sort of I think just made this comment. We work very closely with our customers on design wins. By the way as those Laird and Rogers it's a very key component of the business. So we can see -- again we can see the overall demand out 6 months but we can see where trends are developing where we're going to have nice lift in business. So as Lori just mentioned our adhesives business we are bidding on and working with design in on a lot of applications in the battery and the auto -- next-generation auto market. And we know where we're getting wins or we're close to getting wins. So that's something we track very very closely to look at those trends same within semiconductor same within the water business. So that's important to us to look at also.,0.250394121,0.989683628,0.426829832
225,225,RMD,Farrell:,Thanks for the question Suraj. And since I've answered the first three I'll just correct that our guidance was $300 million to $350 million not $350 million to $400 million what you just said but $300 million to $350 million 0 for the fiscal year. But Jim Hollingshead you run this business. Do you want to do you give as much as you can on the color to Suraj?Thanks Gretel. I'll have a go and maybe Jim can join in as well. But I get the ReSupply is actually very strong. We have Brightree ReSupply. We also have Snap technology that has been incorporated into our Brightree platform that has driven incredible ReSupply. If you remember that really was going strong throughout 2020. So we have some incredibly high comps when you look at the percentage growth rate of masks from this quarter a year ago even despite COVID hitting this time a year ago our mask ReSupply and maybe because of that somewhat with the HMEs focusing on it our mask ReSupply was through the roof this time of a year ago. And even with those comps we're still achieving some very good rates in ReSupply. As I said there are headwinds in it when we're not taking care of all new patients and ResMed gets well over 50% of all marks some new patients no matter whose device it is in the global market. That's a headwind that we're dealing with while this recall continues. But the tailwinds of ReSupply are actually well incorporated into those figures. And I think if you look outside the U.S. market look at Europe Asia and the other 140 countries we operate in you saw pretty strong 18% double-digit growth in masks in those areas and global growth of around 8% which is very strong given the headwinds of new patient setups. But Jim any further color on the U.S. or beyond?Thanks for the question Craig. I'll hand that to Rob Douglas our President and Chief Operating Officer.Yes. And I'll add on maybe just a little bit of color there Craig. I mean it's hard to say because you said what regions and as Rob said we can't say what regions. And even if you would ask a more specific question what countries. It'd be difficult to say there because in the U.S. there are 50 states with all different regulations and some of them are 100% plus capacity and some are at 75% 80% within the state level. And then cities going up and down and China is not just there. It's different regions there as well. So there are ebbs and flows on a daily weekly monthly. But what we can say is on aggregate it is getting better and better. And it's nice to see some cities some states some countries at 100% plus that they're getting through it they're finding ways to embrace digital health home sleep apnea testing and remote setup so that we're able to get the flow of patients going through. Then the challenge we have right now is that we don't have the components of those patients with prescriptions come through to meet all that demand which is the real critical rate limited right now as well. Thanks for your question Craig.Yes David it's a good question. I think everyone had exposure to ResMed products. We're the market leader everyone knew the brand name. Everyone had tried it and we get a large percentage of the prescriptions and actually the share in the 140 countries we operate in. But as you said there are some doctors who liked a particular aspect or a technical aspect or an emotional aspect really or a workflow aspect of some of our competitors' devices or software systems. And to your question they are getting if you like forced exposure because it's the only one available for new patients to ResMed's amazing innovation on the device the software the systems and the flow. And if they had some form of prejudice of device from the '90s that they tried or something and have been stuck with the brand they're now trying a new brand. And I do think to Jim's point earlier that some of that brand-new share of somebody who was in another brand's componentry area says wow this actually is great. My prejudice was wrong. And I think we will get a lot of that share that we'll maintain forever. And I think certainly the exposure of patients to the brands and to understand that has increased. I mean the Net Promoter Score for ResMed amongst patients is rising and the knowledge about the brands for better or for worse through this awful recall is they're getting to know what device they have. And that awareness is actually good for the whole industry because I think physicians and providers and technicians have always been aware of the brands and had prescription biases and others that we absolutely influence through our really strong commercial clinical sales teams. And now we're getting that brand name to new customers as well. So I mean the short answer to your question is yes we've got exposure to new consumers new physicians new providers. And we think a lot of that will be sticky because of the value we provide. The brand is the brand that represents 50% lower labor cost if you're setting up a patient when it represents three less clicks to get a report when it reflects an API that can link into your Epic or your Cerner or your National Health Trust system really efficiently it becomes really part of your day-to-day workflow. And that's the type of share that we think is part of the ResMed brand and will maintain our strong growth for a long period to come through for this period.Yes. Brett I'll hand that question to you.Yes. Thanks for the question Sean. And you're right we don't provide details around pricing. But look clearly this is -- these are unprecedented times costs. As you saw and even just in Brett's last answer there around gross margin and going up. Freight costs I mean sea freight there are over 100 ships just two hours north of me here on the I5 stack outside Long Beach that can't get through. So the sea freight inventory sitting there. It's coming through higher cost than it's ever been. Air freight we have literally chartered planes to fly from Singapore to L.A. and Singapore to Atlanta to get our products to market with this demand. And so those types of things increase costs dramatically. And we have to do that. They're actually consumer planes but no consumers in them and literally just ResMed device is taking off the seats and overhead and so that has impacted our costs. One thing we are doing is with AirSense 11 we are launching that with a price premium. It is excellent innovation. It is not just the best in ResMed for eight years it's the best in the market I think ever as a platform. And so that deserves a price premium and so we will be extracting that. And look we have been working with customers and eliminating some certain discounts and rebates and other things that we had used in the past because those don't apply now. And so we're eliminating some of those costs. And look this is a customer-by-customer region-by-region discussion that happens on a daily basis with our commercial team. But clearly we cannot take all of the costs that have been given to us and we are working with since launch and with appropriate removal of other elements and pricing conditions with customers on a customer basis to address this over time. But our goal -- our laser-focused goal is to make sure we take care of every patient that comes through the channel. And I think that's what you saw during this last quarter.Thanks for the questions Frank. Look I actually have no idea what customers are thinking of the replacement phone versus the replacement devices for our competitor. That's their job to take care of that. If I was a patient I'd want to replace a device. I wouldn't want to replaced phone. That's what I'd say. But I have no idea on that. It's a very very lack of strong communication that I've seen publicly on that. And I can tell you as N equals one I have nothing to add to that. But on the US hospital front I do think as I said in my prepared remarks that we are seeing facilities-based SaaS -- the census rates at skilled nursing facilities are starting to pick up the numbers of patients in beds is picking up. And we actually think -- as you said that there's a pent-up demand for technology to help with that. But Rob do you have any further color on MatrixCare and the Brightree home health and hospice?Steve thanks for the question. And yes good morning to you there in Australia. I think you're not wrong that we would have very strong double-digit growth. And that actually makes sense and has traditionally happened when we launch a new product like the AirSense 11 as our first platform launch in eight years. And as I said in my prep remarks I mean I'm blown away by things like the personal care system watching the care check-in personal therapies or watching the sleep technicians and sleep doctors live at that California Sleep Society engage not just with the presentation from the marketing teams but then sitting down with the clinical teams and walking through this device I think it's a device that deserves to take double-digit growth and take a lot of share. And so I think your calculations there are spot on in terms of this is a double-digit growth time for ResMed in the device space irrespective of this competitive recall irrespective of the comps that we had around COVID and vents and the tailwinds of vents and headwinds of sleep apnea patients coming in a year ago that we're seeing really strong growth of the sleep space. And as Jim said earlier our goal is to entrench people in these amazing workflows that have lower costs and better outcomes and drive therapy to patients in ways never seen before. The part that I'd highlight is this huge take-up of patients signing on to Mya and having a personal relationship with their therapy through the smartphone with Mya is at unprecedented levels. I'm talking double the uptake of AirSense 10. That's one of the highlights that I think has been missed through this. So Steve thanks for the question and the opportunity to highlight that.Great question John. I'll hand that to Jim Hollingshead.So that's a great question Lyanne and quite detailed. I'll hand the first part of the question about ResMed's inventory and what's been happening with the build up there to Brett. And then I'll hand the second part about the inventory at the HMEs HCPs and distributors as they call them in Europe between the US and Europe to Jim Hollingshead. So Brett over to you first and then JimHold on. Sorry Jim is going to answer the second part of that.Yeah. Thanks. I'll start and hand to Rob maybe for some further details. Look we have Bobby Ghoshal our new President of the SaaS division. And I can tell you he's hitting the ground running these last five weeks. He's been in there. And certainly we're seeing some great opportunities for accelerating growth. I think look the externalities that I talked about in the prep remarks that we covered earlier that skilled nursing facility census is coming back so demand is coming back. And we see the book the pipeline book starting to build up. And in a SaaS business that's great because when the pipeline builds up you get the conversions and then it turns into revenue. So we get pretty good visibility even three six nine months out to seeing sort of an acceleration of growth. So I feel pretty confident that those census rates and others that census rates are going up and that we are going to see with MatrixCare is really good products growth in the MatrixCare business to start accelerating there. In addition Brightree and Snap although they're annualizing some of the acquisitions of Snap we're seeing really good adoption of those resupply and some really new innovative tools that the Brightree R&D team are bringing to market. And Bobby was previously COO there and has a good knowledge of that. I think that will accelerate throughout the rest of the fiscal year. But Rob there's so many -- the eight verticals there. What other elements do you have reasons to believe they can accelerate this business?Yeah. Thanks Dan. So look it's a complex and moving dynamic. But the rate-limiting step here is electronic components and specifically the semiconductor chips from a particular manufacturing and a supply chain that I know the names and the people and them talking to them to try and get this supply. The trouble is that there are multiple other industries. And demand for semiconductor chips that are through the roof. And obviously everyone on this call follows many other industries. You've heard this we're not alone in medical device industry automotive industry consumer communications industry even consumer products are often cloud connected now and have these limitations. So look things haven't gone better these last 90 days in terms of supply. They've got very difficult. And our visibility as I look at the June quarter I feel very confident in the semiconductor chips coming through. But in December and March it's hand to mouth of these devices and chartering planes and working with redesigns to make sure the semiconductor chips go so much in. And so our best reading of the dynamics even though we feel in aggregate that $300 million and $350 million which is which is a pretty broad range in itself and has some plus or minus on the top and the bottom end of it that we feel stronger on that June quarter with the supply that we see coming through whereas it's not as strong. I'm closer to the December one now and I know it's going to be tough and March as well. But look things can change on a day-by-day week-by-week month-by-month. And what we're doing is we're being as open as we ever have around supply chain as open as we ever had and transparent about sort of the variability if you like of the flow of these components that come in. I can tell you though we get one more chip it goes into one more device and goes to one patient. And that's the truth. There is no stockpiling of this inventory. It goes all the way straight through to production. And we have an incredibly efficient plan in Singapore and also in Sydney and also manufacturing in Atlanta Georgia and we are not constrained on our internal capacity. As soon as that part comes in that rate-limiting bottleneck part it goes on to a product gets to a customer. And that's what we are focused on. And I'm giving as much color as I can qualitatively around that.Well thanks Kevin and thanks again to all of our shareholders for staying on an extra five to seven minutes here and joining us on this call. I'd also like to thank once again the 8 000 ResMedians many of whom are also shareholders who listen to this call for their dedication and hard work helping people breathe better sleep better and live better lives outside the hospital in 140 countries. Thanks for what you do today and every day. Thanks especially to our ResMed heroes on the front lines during this crisis patient care technical service sales teams working with customers every day but I'd like to add a special call out to our amazing teams on the front lines of supply chain management production distribution all of you are heroes. Every chip you get is a patient's life change. So I look forward to talking with you all again all of our stakeholders here in 90 days. Thank you. I'll turn the call back to Amy to close out.,0.003377514,0.005566657,0.001052075
226,226,PRU,Tanji:,Yes. Thanks Rob. Yes. The long-term interest rates and our assumptions are something that we do look at in our assumption updates annually. We do that by looking at multiple perspectives sort of from an array of economists and banks and asset managers. We also look at the forward curve which as you know has increased recently. And we set our assumption kind of close to the median of that. And also with our assumption update inflation has risen. We factor near-term inflation into our reserve setting as well as for long-term inflation as well. And then part of our assumption update will obviously cover mortality and other policyholder behavior as well including not just our own experience but anything we get in terms of new data from other sources in the industry. We did recently receive a new industry study that indicates experience is more adverse in some of our assumptions of our U.S. life insurance business. We're evaluating this information and its applicability to our business. And to the extent that it would cause an increase in reserves or a decline in earnings. So that -- all that work is underway it will conclude later in the quarter and that will be part of what we report in the second quarter.Initially we're going to use it for reinsuring some of our in-force business but we are gaining experience in Bermuda and our ability to use it -- we will be considering strategies potentially for flow in the future.Alex it's Ken. Yes our traditional -- we've -- we're no longer issuing traditional variable annuities. So it is running off. And after our -- the sale of about 20% of our block of business with PALAC it will continue to run off at about $3 billion a quarter is what you saw in the quarter. So you can kind of think about that as kind of $12 billion to $15 billion a year and that's about an 8% runoff a year. So that combined with the PALAC business that was 20% that over time will get us very close to our objective to reducing our income from traditional variable annuities and having said that we would think about other ways to do that as well.Yes Alex. Yes long-term care is probably where that's most relevant in terms of inflation. We have factored in inflation obviously into our reserves including increases in near term it's -- long-term inflation would be where it's more sensitive. We have provided some of those sensitivities. So -- and overall we think it's very manageable for us.Yes. The charge that we took in the fourth quarter was relevant to the environment at the end of the fourth quarter. We again did a qualitative review of our -- the value of our insurance goodwill and assurance and we did not need any further impairment. So that's where that stands.,0.003091216,0.003147781,5.66E-05
227,227,VICI,Pitoniak,: David do you want to take that?: Jay I will just add that a bit of wisdom that one of our most important and valuable Board members who many of you know Craig Macnab one of the first adages he shared with us is that gentleman the rent should be as low as possible. And we absolutely believe in that. We want our rent to be as low as possible in regard to the economics of the tenant's business because the lower the rent as a percentage of their economics the more successful they will be the better at credit they will be and the more willing and able they will be to occupy the building for a very very long time to come.: David?: David do you want to start? Andâ€¦: David Katz I would just....: Yes David Katz I was just going to add that when we look at retained cash as a capital source. We are very cognizant that is the shareholders' money and our obligation to produce a superior return and investment spread on the use of that cash is every bit as strong as it would be if we're going out into the market raising equity.: Yes. I'd say John we're very confident of that. Are we not?: Well Greg always been good to talk to you and you definitely get the award at least so far for asking the questions that we can and will not answer on this call. I think John did a good job of describing what Tom Reeg was on record saying the other day and I don't know John I think we just -- we leave it there.: You absolutely do. Full marks for asking.: David?: And then Greg -- I was just going to say Greg the key period for CPI measurement for us comes in the early second half of the year isn't that the right way to think about it David?: John and perhaps Samantha you want to take that?: Yes. So I think John there's actually 2 interesting things going on. One is the increasing institutional interest in net lease generally. Any of you who read PERE would have seen yesterday the publication of an article as to how new names like KKR and Aries and Carlyle are coming into the net lease space. And there's obviously been other PE firms and credit firms that are focusing on net lease generally. And then within that lease there is exactly as you're saying or suggesting increased interest from publicly non-traded REITs and net lease-focused private equity firms on what is we believe one of the most compelling forms of triple net real estate there is which is to say gaming real estate. And I think it's important to recognize too that in focusing on gaming -- actually I'm losing the point there. I think the key point is yet that absolute increased interest because of both the superiority of the net lease model generally and the incredible attractiveness of gaming real estate.: Yes. Again I think it goes back to the answer I gave to Smedes John and that is the degree to which there may be a bit of a slack tide right now because to your point as an example the CMBS market has tightened up quite a bit. And there is probably not quite the gold rush fever as there might have been 6 months ago but it has not gone away because these people are sitting on an awful lot of dry powder.: Thank you operator. In closing we thank you for your time with us this morning especially given how busy all of you are. It is insane how much earnings reporting is going on this week in the REIT sector. With your support VICI has become one of America's leading REITs in portfolio scale and quality and in economic magnitude. We will continue to work hard for you every day. We look forward to connecting again when we report our second quarter results. Bye for now.,0.002622277,0.002694011,7.17E-05
228,228,DFS,Hochschild:,Yeah. I would say in general in this business you get diminishing returns on incremental investments in marketing. And so you have seen cycles in the past where people spend heavily after a while they look at the returns they got and maybe less happy with that. So we feel good about both what we're investing on the rewards side and the guidance we provide there of only 2 to 4 basis point increase. But also that we'll see cost per accounts at an attractive level. You're certainly seeing very heavy levels of investment out there that I would wonder whether or not they're going to be sustainable.Yeah. So in terms of our home equity business we do think a rising rate environment will be very constructive. Perversely many households their greatest asset could be their 3% mortgage. So while we're excited about it it also isn't that huge. On the payment side we're excited about our partnership but I don't see tremendous disruption coming to a point of sale and existing means of payment point of sale anytime soon. But we're excited to work with a broad range of partners and different fintechs who want to leverage our network capabilities.Sure. Seeing strength across all categories. Revolver sales growth is probably a little higher than transactors growth but that reflects our lend-focused model. But -- and that sales strength is continuing into April where through say the 24 sales are still up 23% year-over-year. So consumer is good and breadth across all categories. In terms of different segments from a credit standpoint you do tend to see normalization occur faster at the lower end segments. But again we're very pleased and John mentioned that in his comments that the normalization is very much in-line with our expectations.Not necessarily. There's been a lot of volatility just as pandemic restrictions come and go certainly travel growth is up compared to what it was. But I'd really point towards breadth and growth and spend across all categories.Sure. It's still early days. So I probably won't provide much in the way of forecast but we're very excited about the demand we're seeing. We think the product is positioned well to compete both with some of the newer fintech neobanks but also with any traditional branch player that's out there. And overtime the balances build slowly but a lot of opportunities to cross-sell both other deposit products such as savings accounts and CDs but also our broad range of card products and provide really a different entry point into the Discover franchise. So our very much our focus is on building this for the long term. And as we said earlier you'll start seeing more broad market advertising later this year for that product.Yeah. I mean I'd go back to the very kind comments you made at the beginning around 10 years of consistency. Even five years ago a brand value proposition that's for trust for a superior customer experience and for innovation on the feature side. Back then it might have been the ability to freeze your card now it's some of the things we do for our customers in terms of protecting their information online but the focus remains the same. A very strong cash rewards program that competes well with anything out there. Youâ€™re pricing a little more intensity in the cash rewards space as some of the changes on miles programs through the pandemic. But we still compete very much the same way but also still feel as good about our competitive position.Yeah. Sure. So on the fee side first I'd say we have good relationships and enjoyed working closely with all of our regulators and by enlarge are aligned in terms of wanting the consumers to be protected. As you've seen it's a pretty small percent of our revenues. We waived the first late fee for our Discover customers anyway. Right now we're set at the safe harbor to the extent that that changes we can change accordingly. But don't expect it to have an overly material impact. Certainly on the deposit side the fact that we have no fees on any of our deposit products positions us very very well compared to our competitors. And it's a key part of our value proposition. In terms of student loans we probably have seen some pressure on the payment rate just given the ongoing payment holidays that people have seen on their federal loan. It's important to realize that there's a big difference between the federal loan program and ours just in terms of who they give loans to the types of educations they fund. As an example we do nothing in the four-profit sector. So yeah we'll wait and see what comes out of Washington but we don't expect it to be overly disruptive for our own student loan business.Yeah. We've modeled it pretty carefully. We don't expect it to have a significant impact on card or personal loans. And as you think about student loans it's important to look at how we underwrite those. For our undergrad loans the vast majority are cosigned by the parent very strong FICO scores. So we've seen probably a modest benefit on the credit side but also a modest negative on the payment rate as students have more liquidity to put towards paying off their private student loans. And again I'd go back to the federal student loan program in terms of who participates the amount of debt they have and the nature of the education they finance is dramatically different than our portfolio.Great. Thank you.Great. Thank you Ashley. And with that I think we'll conclude. If you have any additional questions please feel free to follow up here in Investor Relations. And have a great day.,0.003628453,0.003999174,0.000313511
229,229,CRWD,Kurtz:,Sure. Well as weâ€™ve talked about in the past weâ€™ve built a tremendous sales machine and we spent a lot of time obviously focusing on the scalability of the technology but also the scalability of the sales machine. And things like trial to pay in-app trials creating frictionless ways to actually cross-sell into our customer base thatâ€™s really important for what we do. And when we think about the next 10 000 or beyond and as you said 10 0 11 000 is fantastic. But when you look at other competitors over the many many years theyâ€™ve had hundreds of thousands. So we certainly think we can be in that arena in the future. And it goes to I think a very efficient go-to-market motion. Burt talked about our Magic Number of 1.4. And it also combines with the fact that weâ€™ve built an e-commerce platform behind or below if you will the Falcon platform. So the platform is designed to sell itself and to get new customers and we spend a lot of time on digital to trial to pay and then conversions. And whether itâ€™s a small customer or whether itâ€™s a large one in enterprise once we get them in the door we certainly canâ€™t convert them with a credit card but obviously the bigger customers will engage on the sales team and a partner and close deals. And now with things like AWS and GCP and EY weâ€™ve expanded our partner network. So we feel really good about the flywheel weâ€™ve built and the scalability -- sales scalability built into the platform.Sure. I think thematically its customers are looking for a next-gen endpoint workload technology platform like CrowdStrike combined with next-gen network technology and theyâ€™re looking to replace their legacy Palo Alto Networks. And we spent -- or others. And we spent a lot of time in the field and weâ€™ve set up compensation structures between the two organizations where both sales teams are incented to help each other out which is always good in the field. And weâ€™ve done the integration. So when we think about understanding what happens out of the network obviously weâ€™re not a network company that information can be supplied to us in the Falcon platform. And weâ€™ve got tremendous visibility on the endpoints that go beyond anything a network company could have and thatâ€™s useful to Zscaler customers. So when you put the two of them together we think itâ€™s better together. And weâ€™ve got a huge hotel company that uses both Zscaler and CrowdStrike. And it has just been amazing to see the technologies work together and theyâ€™ve been a big fan and a big proponent of us putting these integrations together. So I think itâ€™s good for customers and itâ€™s good for both parties.Sure. Good to connect here. When you look at the -- some of the orders that have come out of the White House it will -- if you will itâ€™s like -- lines up with our strategy lines up with what we do. And I think certainly the federal government can benefit and has been benefiting from our technology. We spent our initial foray into the civilian agencies and that gives you a beachhead into some of the broader intelligence agencies. So weâ€™ve gotten a lot of our certifications that has taken some time. Thatâ€™s just a process that anyone has to go through. We put the effort in and spend the money to do it. And we think weâ€™re set up for success. So weâ€™ve seen some really nice wins big wins in the federal space. And we think thatâ€™s going to continue to carry forward. And when we think about federal thatâ€™s just one piece of the government. Obviously state and local weâ€™ve had tremendous wins. A lot of the states in the U.S. certainly have adopted CrowdStrike a lot of municipalities and communities. And as youâ€™ve seen with ransomware and some of the other forest attacks that are out there typically they are under protected and they need technologies like CrowdStrike. And they typically donâ€™t have the people power to do it. So we feel really good about fed state and local from a platform perspective.Sure. Itâ€™s a good question. And I think weâ€™re still in the early innings maybe second inning in terms of our ability to continue to take share. And actually just today IDC released an updated worldwide market share stat from modern endpoint security and CrowdStrike was ranked number one ahead of Microsoft and other legacy vendors. So we feel really good about where we are. But as we talked about earlier on the call 11 000-plus customers fantastic but thereâ€™s a lot of companies out there big and small and we still think weâ€™ve got a lot of runway and still continue the migration of -- and share from Symantec and McAfee to CrowdStrike. So still early on but obviously lots of progress that weâ€™re proud of.Yes sure. So we went through some of the prepared remarks in terms of our efficacy and some of the latest results that weâ€™ve seen with the testing organizations. Iâ€™ll point you back to those 100% for the last couple of months. Obviously thatâ€™s just one piece of it right? You have to look at the entire system and itâ€™s designed to stop breaches. And we stopped last year I think 65 000 -- or 75 0 I should say in process breaches. So we know the technology works. We know it has extremely high efficacy. MITRE ATT&CK we had 100% coverage across the 20 different groups. And thereâ€™s a reason why weâ€™re winning. The technology works the technology scales. And itâ€™s designed to catch things across the kill chain. Even if something slips through one part of the kill chain is designed to catch it in the second part and stop breaches. And thatâ€™s what weâ€™ve done from the beginning and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going to continue to do.Sure. I mean you can -- any company has lots of data itâ€™s the value and what you do with it. And I think CrowdStrike has proven our ability to utilize the data. And whether thatâ€™s in training our AI algorithms or whether thatâ€™s creating a product that can actually be quickly searched and insights be gained. With our Threat Graph weâ€™ve pioneered cloud delivery end point and graft technology specific to security. So I think that continues. With Humio youâ€™ve got fantastic technology extremely fast extremely efficient in-memory index-free driving down the cost compared to legacy technologies that are out there on the lock side. And that will be a key part of our XDR extension in our strategy. And weâ€™ve seen fantastic feedback from customers. I called out some big wins that we had with Humio. And as that gets integrated which weâ€™re working on we feel really good about having the ability to pull other information besides CrowdStrike data into our data platform and our Threat Graph and make that available to customers. So I think it comes down to -- again thereâ€™s a lot of marketing noise in the marketplace. But when you actually look at the technology which we have and why we bought Humio we feel really good about it as a next-gen technology thatâ€™s going to be a good fit for our platform.Well I would say much more frequently now. Obviously Horizon is still a relatively new entrant into our portfolio as of last year. But we talked about Cloudera is a good example. That was a company who had our traditional endpoint protection and obviously now adopted our cloud technology. So we have a big base that we can go into and cross sell which we are. And part of the conversation with any new customer is about what youâ€™re doing in the cloud and how youâ€™re protecting it. Some companies they have a different time scale or path to the cloud. And it may not line up exactly to what theyâ€™re doing internally or for their end points. But every sales call certainly at the larger enterprise in the medium weâ€™re talking about our cloud technology. Itâ€™s really about the platform play. And again weâ€™ve seen tremendous success in the overall adoption just over the last couple of quarters with it. So itâ€™s been out less than a year. But I think when you look at how fast weâ€™re innovating in that area and our ability to actually sell into dev ops we feel really good about its future.Okay. I want to thank all of you for your time today. We certainly appreciate your interest and look forward to seeing you virtually at our upcoming investor events. Stay safe and weâ€™ll talk soon. Thank you.,0.004455119,0.00922364,0.002754206
230,230,PEG,Izzo,: Yeah Jerry I mean I think the one thing that I would look at is some of the shape that we have as you look at the year as a whole. We we'll have a shift in capacity revenues as we go through the year and those will come off based upon the auctions that we've already seen. We have another auction coming up in about a month or so we'll get back to a regular process there but there's a little bit of tax movement that you see throughout the year as we book to an annual effective tax rate and some of the recontracting has a little shape to it. So I would say that we reiterated guidance for CFIO and kind of hold just to that blanket statement.: Jeremy that the temptation's always to give you a play by play but they are confidential settlement discussions. And I would simply say look we go out of our way to pick things that are essential from a reliability point of view and consistent with stay a policy but those discussions have just started and I want to be respectful of great council and the BPU staff that they've asked us to treat those confidentially and I owe that to them.: There's no end of the abuse we take on this. I just want you to know how hard it was to find another Ralph.: Well Julian believe it or not we actually expected that question. So well you look we try to get the cadence and not change our earnings guidance with every quarterly call for the long-term. So what we'll do is you we'll fill you -- on our hedge position if you want to predict where the market will be tomorrow that that's okay. We just try to radically hedge in and in September we'll have an investor conference and we'll give you â€˜23 guidance and multi-year guidance at that point. And a lot of the benefit of a few more months of market purchases and but yeah we'd rather not start adjusting our four year CAGR or five year CAGR with every quarterly call. So that's how we justify it.,0.003553569,0.003553569,0
